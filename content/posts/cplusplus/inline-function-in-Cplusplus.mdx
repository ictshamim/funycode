## Inline Function in C++
Inline functions are functions which are expanded inline. To make a function inline we simple put keyword inline before the functions definitions.

- These functions are different from normal functions that in normal function call control is transferred to the place where the actual function definition is written.
- For example, consider the following dummy code of the program:
~~~js
void main( )
    {
    void show( );
        statements;
    show( ); //function called here
        statements; // next statement where function returns
    statements;
    }
void show( )
    {
    statements;
    }
~~~
- During the execution of the program when function call show is encountered, compiler saves the state of various registers, variables occurred in the program prior to function call show.
- It also saves the address of the next instruction after the function call show as it has to return to this statement when function show returns.
- All these are saved onto the stack as stack-frame or activation record.
- Inline function is not work in the way as explained above manner. They are expanded where they are called.
- That is the whole body of the inline function is put at the place where function was called.
- This saves time as there is no control transfer, no saving and popping back from stack-frame.
- So inline function executes faster than normal function. But at the place of inline function call, the code is expanded.
- If you have called inline function from 100 places in your program, the code will be expanded 100 places in your program thus increasing program size.
- So a trade-off between program size and execution efficiency is there. The general syntax of defining the inline functions as:
~~~js
inline return type function_name (parameters)
    {
    function definition;
    }
~~~
## Some Important Points About Inline Function
- Inline function is a request to the compiler thus inline function may not work as inline some times.
- In this regard they differ from macro, which work as macro always.
- Inline function executes faster than normal function.
- Strict type checking is performed for variables that are passed as arguments, which is not done in case of macro.
- Inline function does not produce side effects whereas macro does.
- All inline functions must be defined prior to their use.
- Inline function does not work as inline when code contains loops, recursions, goto, switch, static variable etc.
- They are used where function definition are small so calling cost and overhead for normal functions can be minimized.
## Critical situations for inline function
- If a loop, a switch or a goto exists in function body.
- If function is not returning any value.
- If function contains static variables.
- If function is recursive.

### Example-1: Write a C++ program to illustrate inline function.
~~~js
//Write a C++ program to illustrate inline function.
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
inline void show( )
    {
    cout<<"Hello from inline show\n";
    }
int main( )
    {
    show( );
    }
~~~
~~~
Output:
Hello from inline show
~~~
## Explanation
- The function show is inline so when it is called in the main it is simply expanded in the main.
- That is, all the statements written in the function show appear at the place of function call.
- Here we are having just one cout statement so it appear through we have written cout statement within main itself similar to macro.
### Example-2: Write a C++ program to find the square of a number using inline function.
~~~js
//Write a C++ program to find the square of a number using inline function.
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
inline int square(int x)
    {
    return x*x;
    }
int main( )
    {
    int num,snum;
    cout<<"Enter a number \n";
    cin>>num;
    cout<<"Square of "<<num<<"is "<<square(num)<<endl;
    }
~~~
~~~
Output:
Enter a number
20
Square of 20is 400
~~~

### Example-3: Write a C++ program to find the cube of a number using inline function.
~~~js
//Write a C++ program to find the cube of a number using inline function.
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
inline int cube(int x)
    {
    return x*x*x;
    }
int main( )
    {
    int num;
    cout<<"Enter a number \n";
    cin>>num;
    cout<<"Cube of "<<num<<"is "<
    }
~~~
~~~
Output:
Enter a number
5
Cube of 5 is 125
~~~
### Example-4: Write a C++ program to enter two number and find the maximum number using inline function.
~~~js
//Write a C++ program to enter two number and find the maximum number using inline function.
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
inline int max(int x,int y)
    {
    return x>y ? x :y;
    }
int main( )
    {
    int n1,n2;
    cout<<"Enter two numbers \n";
    cin>>n1>>n2;
    int m=max(n1,n2);
    cout<<"Max="<<m<<endl;
    }
~~~
~~~
Output:
Enter two numbers
12
45
Max=45
~~~
