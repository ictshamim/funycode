## Identifier and Constant (Literal) in C++
Identifiers refer to the names of variables, functions, arrays, classes etc., created by the programmer. Each language has its own rules for naming these identifiers.

- Every programming language has certain rules for defining the names of variables, functions, classes, etc. Such names are known as identifiers.
- C++ follows almost the same set of rules for defining an identifier as C does.
- It can be a sequence of one or more characters including underscore symbol (_). Example – Barlength or Bar_length are valid names.
- There should be no white (blank) spaces in an identifier. It should be a single word.
- Bar length is invalid. Box volume is invalid while Boxvolume or Box_volume are valid.
- There should be no marked character in the identifier

- There is no limit on length of name in C++. However, in C it is limited to 32 characters. Better have a check on the compiler you are using.
- Identifier should never start with a digit. It should always start with an alphabet or underline symbol, however, digits can be part of identifier. 2A is invalid while A2 and _2A are valid.
- It should not have any other symbol except alphabets, digits and underscore symbol.
   - Example- Newdelhi_2 is valid but Newdelhi-2 or Newdelhi(2) are invalid identifiers.
- It must not be a keyword of C++. Thus double or int are invalid identifiers while Double or Int or INT are valid identifiers.
- Besides the keywords the specific reserved words for the compiler should not be used as identifiers.
- The alternative representations of some operators of C++ also should not be used as identifiers. These 11 words are given below. and, and_eq, bitand, bitor, compl, not, not_eq, or, or_eq, xor, xor-eq
## Constant (Literal)
- Constants are expressions with a fixed value.
- C++ supports all literals supported by C, though there are some additional ones as well.
- Literals are used to express particular values within the source code of a program.
- In C++, it is possible to define L’A’ as a wide character constant.
- This constant is wide, that is, it is of 16-bit storage rather than the normal 8-bit ASCII (hence L precedes ‘A’).
- Using wide characters, it is possible to accommodate characters in the unicode format.
- Some languages such as Chinese and Japanese have thousands of characters, which do not conform to the small footprint of ASCII.
- The unicode format enables C++ to read, print, and store characters of such languages.
- The constant L’A’ is actually of type wchar_t, which is an addition to the C++ standard.
- Literal constants can be divided in Integer Numerals, Floating-Point Numerals, Characters, Strings and Boolean Values.
## Integer Numerals
- The following are numerical constants that identify integer decimal values.
~~~
1776
707
-273
~~~
- Notice that to express a numerical constant we do not have to write quotes (“) nor any special character.
- There is no doubt that it is a constant: whenever we write 1776 in a program, we will be referring to the value 1776.
- In addition to decimal numbers (those that all of us are used to use every day) C++ allows the use as literal constants of octal numbers (base 8) and hexadecimal numbers (base 16).
- If we want to express an octal number we have to precede it with a 0 (zero character).
- And in order to express a hexadecimal number we have to precede it with the characters 0x (zero, x). For example, the following literal constants are all equivalent to each other:
~~~
75 // decimal
0113 // octal
0x4b // hexadecimal
~~~
- All of these represent the same number: 75 (seventy-five) expressed as a base-10 numeral, octal numeral and hexadecimal numeral, respectively.
- Literal constants, like variables, are considered to have a specific data type.
- By default, integer literals are of type int. However, we can force them to either be unsigned by appending the u character to it, or long by appending l:
~~~
75 // int
75u // unsigned int
75l // long
75ul // unsigned long

~~~
- In both cases, the suffix can be specified using either upper or lowercase letters.
## Floating Point Numbers
- They express numbers with decimals and/or exponents.
- They can include either a decimal point, an e character (that expresses “by ten at the Xth height”, where X is an integer value that follows the e character), or both a decimal point and an e character:

~~~
3.14159 // 3.14159
6.02e23 // 6.02 x 10^23
1.6e-19 // 1.6 x 10^-19
3.0 // 3.0
~~~
- These are four valid numbers with decimals expressed in C++.
- The first number is PI, the second one is the number of Avogadro, the third is the electric charge of an electron (an extremely small number) -all of them approximated- and the last one is the number three expressed as a floating-point numeric literal.
## Character and string literals
- There also exist non-numerical constants, like:
~~~
'z'
'p'
"Hello world"
"How do you do?"
~~~
- The first two expressions represent single character constants, and the following two represent string literals composed of several characters.
- Notice that to represent a single character we enclose it between single quotes (‘) and to express a string (which generally consists of more than one character) we enclose it between double quotes (“).
## Boolean literals
- There are only two valid Boolean values: true and false.
- These can be expressed in C++ as values of type bool by using the Boolean literals true and false.
## Defined constants (#define)
- You can define your own names for constants that you use very often without having to resort to memory-consuming variables, simply by using the #define preprocessor directive. Its format is:
## #define identifier value
For example:
~~~
#define PI 3.14159
#define NEWLINE '\n'
~~~
- This defines two new constants: PI and NEWLINE. Once they are defined, you can use them in the rest of the code as if they were any other regular constant.
### Example-1: Write a C ++ program to calculate circumference using defined constant.
~~~js
//Write a C ++ program to calculate circumference using defined constant.
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
#define PI 3.14159
#define NEWLINE '\n'
int main ()
    {
    double r=5.0; // radius
    double circle;
    circle = 2 * PI * r;
    cout << circle;
    cout << NEWLINE;
    return 0;
    }
~~~
~~~
Output:
31.4159
~~~
### Example-2: Write a C ++ program to define integer, float and character constant and print them.
~~~js
//Write a C ++ program to define integer, float and character constant and print them.
#include<iostream>
#define val 100
#define floatVal 40.5
#define charVal 'Gt'
using namespace std;
    int main()
    {
    cout<<"Integer Constant:"<<val;
    cout<<"\nFloating point Constant:"<<floatVal;
    cout<<"\nCharacter Constant: \n"<<charVal;
    return 0;
    }
~~~
~~~
Output:
Integer Constant: 100
Floating point Constant: 40.5
Character Constant: Gt
Declared constants (const)
~~~
- With the const prefix you can declare constants with a specific type in the same way as you would do with a variable:
~~~
const int pathwidth = 100;
const char tabulator = '\t';
~~~
- Here, pathwidth and tabulator are two typed constants.
- They are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
