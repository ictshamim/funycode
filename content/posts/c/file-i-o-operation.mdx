## File Handling in C
### Built in Function
In order to perform the file operations in C we must use the high level I/O functions which are in C standard I/O library. They are

## getc() and putc() functions

- getc()/fgetc() : It is used to read a character from a file that has been opened in a read mode.
- It reads a character from the file whose file pointer is fp. The file pointer moves by one character for every operation of getc(). The getc() will return an end-of –marker EOF, when an end of file has been reached.
~~~
Syntax: getc(fp);
Ex: char ch;
ch=getc(fp);
putc()/fputc()
~~~
- It is used to write a character contained in the character variable to the file associated with the FILE pointer fp. fputc() also returns an end-of –marker EOF, when an end of file has been reached.
~~~js
Syntax: putc(c,fp);
Example: char c;
putc(c,fp);
~~~

### Example-1: Write a C program to implement fgetc() and fputc() function in file.
~~~js
// Write a C program to implement fgetc() and fputc() function in file.c() and fputc():
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
    {
    FILE *fp;
    char ch;
    fp=fopen("input1.txt","w");
    printf("\n enter some text hereand press cntrl D or Z to stop :\n");
    while((ch=getchar())!=EOF)
        fputc(ch,fp);
    fclose(fp);
    fp=fopen("input1.txt","r");
    printf("\n The entered text is : \n");
    while((ch=fgetc(fp))!=EOF)
        putchar(ch);
    fclose(fp);
    }
~~~

## fprintf() and fscanf()

- In order to handle a group of mixed data simultaneously there are two functions that are fprintf() and fscanf().
- These two functions are identical to printf and scanf functions, except that they work on files.
- The first argument of these functions is a file pointer which specifies the file to be used.
~~~
fprintf(): The general form of fprintf() is
Syntax: fprintf(fp,”control string”,list);
~~~
- where fp is a file pointer associated with a file that has been opened for writing .
- The control string contains output specifications for the items in the list. .
~~~
Example: fprintf(fp,”%s%d”,name,age);
fscanf() : It is used to read a number of values from a file.
Syntax: fscanf(fp,”control string”,list);
Example: fscanf(fp2,”%s %d”,item,&quantity);
~~~
- like scanf , fscanf also returns the number of items that are successfully read. when the end of file is reached it returns the value EOF.

### Example-2: Write a C program to implement fscanf() and fprintf() function in file.
~~~js
//Write a C program to implement fscanf() and fprintf() function in file.
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
    {
    int a=22,b;
    char s1[20]="Welocme_to_c",s2[20];
    float c=12.34,d;
    FILE *f3;
    f3=fopen("mynew3","w");
    fprintf(f3,"%d %s %f",a,s1,c);
    fclose(f3);
    f3=fopen("mynew3","r");
    fscanf(f3,"%d %s %f",&b,s2,&d);
    printf("\n a=%d \t s1=%s \t c=%f \n b=%d \t s2=%s \t d=%f",a,s1,c,b,s2,d);
    fclose(f3);
    }
~~~
## getw() and putw()

- The getw() and putw()are integer oriented functions .They are similar to the getc() and putc() functions and are used to read and write integer values .
- These functions would be useful when we deal with only integer data. The general form of getw() and putw() are
~~~js
Syntax: putw(integer,fp);
Syntax: getw(fp);
~~~
### Example-3: Write a C program to implement getw() and putw() function in file.
~~~js
//Write a C program to implement getw() and putw() function in file.
/*Printing odd numbers in odd file and even numbers in even file*/
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
    {
    int x,i;
    FILE *f1,*fo,*fe;//creating a file pointer
    f1=fopen("anil.txt","w"); //opening a file
    printf("\n enter some numbers into file or -1 to stop \n");
    for(i=0;i<20;i++)
        {
        scanf("%d",&x);
        if(x== -1)break;
        putw(x,f1); //writing read number into anil.txt file one at a time
        }
    fclose(f1); //closing a file opened for writing input
    printf("\n OUTPUT DATA\n");
    f1=fopen("anil.txt","r");//open anil in read mode to read data
    fo=fopen("odd3f","w");
    fe=fopen("even3f","w");
    while((x=getw(f1))!=EOF)
        {
        printf("%d\t",x);
        if(x%2==0)
            putw(x,fe);
        else
            putw(x,fo);
        }
    fcloseall();
    fo=fopen("odd3f","r");
    printf("\n contents of odd file are :\n");
    while((x=getw(fo) )!= EOF)
        printf(" %d\t",x);
    fe=fopen("even3f","r");
    printf("\n contents of even file are :\n");
    while((x=getw(fe)) != EOF)
        printf(" %d\t",x);
    fcloseall();
    }
~~~

## fputs() and fgets()

- fgets(): It is used to read a string from a file pointed by file pointer.
- It copies the string to a memory location referred by an array.
~~~js
Syntax: fgets(string,length,filepointer);
Example: fgets(text,50,fp1);
~~~
- fputs(): It is used to write a string to an opened file pointed by file pointer.
~~~
Syntax: fputs(string,filepointer);
Example: fputs(text,fp);
~~~
### Exampe-4: Write a C program to implement fgets() and fputs() function in file.
~~~js
//Write a C program to implement fgets() and fputs() function in file.
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
    {
    FILE *fp;
    char str[50];
    fp=fopen("fputget.txt","r");
    printf("\n the read string is :\n");
    fgets(str,50,fp);
    puts(str);
    fclose(fp);
    fp=fopen("fputget.txt","a+");
    printf("\n Enter string : \n");
    gets(str);
    fputs(str,fp);
    puts(str);
    fclose(fp);
    }
~~~
## fread() and fwrite()

- fwrite(): It is used for writing an entire structure block to a given file in binary mode.

~~~
Syntax: fwrite(&structure variable,sizeof(structure variable),1,filepointer);
Example: fwrite(&stud,sizeof(stud),1,fp);
~~~
- fread(): It is used for reading an entire structure block from a given file in binary mode.
~~~js
Syntax: fread(&structure variable,sizeof(structure variable),1,filepointer);
Example: fread(&emp,sizeof(emp),1,fp1);
~~~
### Example-5: Write a C program to implement fread() and fwrite() function in file.
~~~js
//Write a C program to implement fread() and fwrite() function in file.
#include<stdio.h>
struct player
    {
    char pname[30];
    int age;
    int runs;
    };
void main()
    {
    struct player p1,p2;
    FILE *f3;
    f3=fopen("player.txt","w");
    printf("\n Enter details of player name ,age and runs scored :\n ");
    fflush(stdin);
    scanf("%s %d %d",p1.pname,&p1.age,&p1.runs);
    fwrite(&p1,sizeof(p1),1,f3);
    fclose(f3);
    f3=fopen("player.txt","r");
    fread(&p2,sizeof(p2),1,f3);
    fflush(stdout);
    printf("\nPLAYERNAME:=%s\tAGE:=%d\tRUNS:=%d ",p2.pname,p2.age,p2.runs);
    fclose(f3);
    }
