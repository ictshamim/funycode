## Data Input/output in String
This is also called as run time initialization. The integers, character and float data types are read by using functions such as scanf(), gets, etc. Similarly, to read a string two functions are used. They are

1. scanf()
2. gets()
## Reading Strings Using scanf ( )
- To read strings using scanf() format specifier %s is used with the function scanf().For example
~~~js
char name[10];
~~~
- To input data in to char array ’name’, scanf function and %s is used as given below.
~~~js
scanf("%s",name);
~~~
- Note that the %s format specifier doesn’t require the ampersand (&) symbol before the variable name.
- The major limitation of scanf() is that it reads until occurrence of first separator a white space characters such as space character, tab or new line and store it into given variable.
- For example if the input literal is “How are you?”. Then the scanf statement will read only the word ‘How’ into the variable name.
- To overcome this limitation, gets() and getchar() functions are used.
## Reading Strings using gets( )
- The gets() functions reads the string from the keyboard including spaces until the enter key is not pressed. The getchar() function is used to get a single charater. The gets() and getchar() functions are defined in stdio.h library file. For example
~~~js
char line[100];
printf("Enter a line:\n");
gets(line);
puts("Entered input is :\n");
puts(line);
~~~
- The gets() function keeps reading characters from the standard input stream until a new line character or end-of-file is encountered.
- Instead of saving the new line character, the gets() function appends a null character to the array that is referenced by the argument to the gets() function.
## Print strings
- To out put data of the given string two functions are used. They are

1. printf()

2. puts ()

## Printing strings using printf()
- The printf statement along with format specifier %s is used to print strings on the screen. The format %s can be used to display an array of characters that is terminated by the null character. For example,
~~~js
printf(“%s”, name);
~~~
- It can be used to display the entire contents of the array name.
- Printf expects to receive a string as an additional parameter when it sees %s in the format string.
- This additional parameter

   – Can be from a character array.

   – Can be another literal string.

   – Can be from a character pointer

- Printf knows how much to print out because of the NULL character at the end of all strings. When printf() encounters a null\0, it stops printing. The string variable can be printed out with precision using printf() statement.

## Printing strings using puts( )
- The puts function is a much simpler output function than printf for string printing. Prototype of puts is defined in stdio.h For example:
~~~js
char sentence[] = "This is strings in C \n";
puts(sentence);
This Prints out:
This is strings in C
~~~
- Consider a simple program to understand string input and output functions.
~~~js
#include<stdio.h>
main()
    {
    char str[80] ; Char str2[45];
    printf("Enter a string: ") ;
    gets(str1) ;
    printf("Enter another string: ") ;
    scanf(“%s“,str2); /*Reads upto first white space character*/
    Printf(“output of first string:\n”);
    printf("%s" , str1\n);
    Printf(“output of second string:\n”);
    puts(“str2 “)
    }
~~~
~~~
Output:
Input:
Enter a string: This is c language.
Enter another string: This is strings
Output:
Output of first string: This is c language
Output of second string: This
