An array is a collection of similar elements. The first element in the array is numbered 0, so the last element is 1 less than the size of the array. An array is also known as a subscripted variable. Before using an array its type and dimension must be declared. Many applications require the processing of multiple data items that have common characteristics in such a situation it is convenient to place data items into an array. So individual data items can be char, int, floating point numbers and so on. A large number of exercise and solution in array has been completed using C, C++ and Java. Start your journey in array with C,C++ and Java programming languages.
