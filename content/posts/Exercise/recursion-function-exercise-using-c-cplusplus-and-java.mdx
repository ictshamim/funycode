Recursion is the process which comes into existence when a function calls a copy of itself to work on a
smaller problem. Any function which calls itself is called recursive function, and such function calls are
called recursive calls. Recursion involves several numbers of recursive calls. However, it is important to
impose a termination condition of recursion. Recursion code is shorter than iterative code however it is
difficult to understand. The recursion function exercise program list has been given bellow. All the programs have
been solved in three programming languages are C, C++ and Java. Start your journey with C, C++ and
Java programming with the recursion function program list-
