## Feature of OOP in Java
The fundamental idea behind OOPS is to combine both data and functions into single unit. Such unit is called an object. Class is a template, blueprint or contract that defines what an objects data fields and methods will be. A Java class uses variables to define data fields and methods to define actions. An object represents an entity in the real world that can be distinctly identified. General concepts
- Objects
- Classes
- Data Abstractions
- Data Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Dynamic Binding
- Message Passing

## Objects
- Objects are basic run time entitles in an object oriented system.
- They may represent a person, a place, a bank account that a program must handle.
- They may also be a user defined functions such as vectors, date and time. Program object should be chosen such that they match closely the real world object example.
- Elements of computer user environment are windows, menus and graphics objects.
- The ph1ysical objects are automobile in graphics stimulation, electronic
- component in circuit designing.
- The match between programming objects and a real world objects is a good resulting.
- Objects offering the revolution in programming.

## Classes
- In OOPS, objects are the members of classes almost all computer languages have built in data types like integer, float etc.
- In similar way you can define many objects of same class and the entire code of an object can be made a user define data type with the help of a class.
- A class is thus a collection of objects of similar type. For e.g staff and students are the members of the college.
- It is significantly useful as it is used to combine the data and operations into a single entity.

## Data Encapsulation
- The wrapping up of data and function into a single unit is called as “Encapsulation”.
- The data is not accessible to the outside world and only those functions which are members of class can access the data.
- These functions provide interface between objects and programs. This insulation of data from direct access by program is called as data hiding.

## Data Abstraction
- Data Abstraction refers to the representation of essential features without including background details or explanations.
- Classes use the concept of abstraction and are defined as a list of abstract attributes such as size, cost, etc.
- It avoids undesired side effects of the member data when it is defined out of the class and also protects the intentional misuse of important data.
- Classes efficiently manage the complexity of large programs through encapsulation.

## Inheritance
- It is a process by which the object of one class acquires the properties of objects of another class.
- It supports the concept of hierarchical classification. For e.g. sparrow is apart of class flying birds which again is a part of class bird.
- The principle behind this is that each derived class shares the common characteristics with the class from which it is derived.
- In OOPS, the concept of inheritance provides the idea of reusability if we can add additional features of an existing class without modifying it.
- This is possible by deriving a new class from existing one. The new class will have the combined features of both the classes.

## Polymorphism
- Polymorphism means the ability to take more than one form.
- For e.g. an operation may exhibit different behavior in different instants.
- The behavior depends upon the types of data used in the operation.
- For example consider operation addition for two numbers, the operation will generate sum.
- If operands are strings the operation would perform a third string by concatenation.
- To handle function overloading a single function name can be used to handle different numbers and different types of arguments.
- This is something similar to particular word having several different meanings depending upon the context

## Dynamic binding
- Binding refers to a linking procedure called to the code which is to be executed in response to the call.
- Dynamic binding means that the code associated with a given procedure called is not known until the time of call at the run time.
- Consider a procedure ‘draw’ shown in a fig by inheritance every object will have this procedure.
- This ‘draw’ procedure will be redefined in each class that defines the object.
- At the run time, the code matching the object under current reference will be called.

## Message communication
- An object-oriented program consists of set of objects that communicate with each other.
- The process of programming in an object oriented language involves following basic steps: –
   - Creating classes that define object and their behavior.
   - Creating object from class definition.
   - Establishing communication among object.
- Objects may communicate with one another by sending and receiving information through functions.
- A message for an object is a request for execution of a procedure. Therefore it involves a function in receiving object that generates desired results.
