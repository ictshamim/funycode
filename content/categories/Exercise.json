  "description": "Programming is not something that you can learn in a classroom or from a book. It’s not a conceptual entity; it’s a way of thinking. Training your brain requires practice. It’s much like learning to play piano, or learning to play chess, or even learning to speak a foreign language. It’s all about practice. \nThe Programming is about being able to solve a analytical problem whose solution is a program. For doing this, we must develop our problem-solving skills by exposing ourselves to various kinds of problems and applications. This requires practice. A large number of problems have been analyzed and solved using C, C++ and Java programming Languages to increase the programming skills. \n"
