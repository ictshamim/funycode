## Constructor and Destructor in Inheritance
Assume a small example of single level inheritance in which class A is inherited by class B.

- Both the classes have their default constructors.
- When an object of class B is created, it calls the constructor of class B, but as this class B has got A as its parent class, constructor of class A will be called first, then constructor of class then obviously it will be using the data members from base class.
- Now without calling the constructor of base class, data members of base class, unexpected results may follow.
- Calling a constructor of base class first allows base class to properly set up its data members of that they can be used by derived classes.
- In case of destructor in inheritance, destructor of derived class is called first and then destructor of base class is called.
- This is so as it is possible that if we call destructor of base class first, destructor might be working with data members of base class.
- So, destroying them in base class has an effect of working with the data members that no longer exist. Compiler won’t allow this.
- That’s why destructor class call as first so that it can do its works finishing with any of the data members of class base and do its own cleaning.
### Example-1: Write a C++ program to illustrate the constructor in single level inheritance.
~~~js
//Write a C++ program to illustrate inheritance in single level inheritance.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class first
    {
    public :
    first( )
        {
        cout<<"Hello from con of first"<<endl;
        }
    };
class second :public first
    {
    public :
    second( ) :first( )
        {
        cout<<"Hello from con of second"<<endl;
        }
    };
int main( )
    {
    second s;
    }
~~~
~~~
Output:
Hello from con of first
Hello from con of second
~~~
### Example-2: Write a C++ program to illustrate the  constructor and destructor in single level inheritance.
~~~js
//Write a C++ program to illustrate the  constructor and destructor in single level inheritance.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class first
{
public :
first( )
        {
        cout<<"Hello from con"<<endl;
        }
        ~first( )
        {
        cout<<"Bye Bye from des of first "<<endl;
        }
    };
class second : public first
    {
    public :
    second( ) :first( )
        {
        cout<<"Hello from con of second"<<endl;
        }
    ~second( )
        {
        cout<<"Bye Bye from des of second"<<endl;
        }
    };
int main( )
    {
    second s;
    }
~~~
~~~
Output:
Hello from con
Hello from con of second
Bye Bye from des of second
Bye Bye from des of first
~~~
### Example-3: Write a C++ program to illustrate the  constructor in multi level inheritance.
~~~js
//Write a C++ program to illustrate the  constructor and destructor in multi level inheritance.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class first
    {
    public :
    first( )
        {
        cout<<"Hello from con of first"<<endl;
        }
    };
class second :public first
    {
    public :
    second ( ) : first( )
        {
        cout<<"Hello from con of second "<<endl;
        }
    };
class third : second
    {
    public :
    third( ) :second ( )
        {
        cout<<"Hello from con of third"<<endl;
        }
    };
int main( )
    {
    third t;
    }
~~~
~~~
Output:
Hello from con of first
Hello from con of second
Hello from con of third
~~~
### Example-4: Write a C++ program to illustrate the  constructor  in multiple level inheritance.
~~~js
//Write a C++ program to illustrate the  constructor  in multiple level inheritance.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class first
    {
    public :
    first ( )
        {
        cout<<"Hello from con first"<<endl;
        }
    };
class second
    {
    public :
    second( )
        {
        cout<<"Hello from con of second"<<endl;
        }
    };
class third :second, first
    {
    public :
    third( )
        {
        cout<<"Hello from con of third"<<endl;
        }
    };
int main( )
    {
    third t;
    }
~~~
~~~
Output:
Hello from con of second
Hello from con first
Hello from con of third
~~~
### Example-5: Write a C++ program to illustrate the parametrized constructor  in inheritance.
~~~js
//Write a C++ program to illustrate the parametrized constructor  in inheritance.
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class first
{
int fa;
public :
first (int x)
        {
        fa=x;
        cout<<"Con of first called"<<endl;
        }
    void fshow( )
        {
        cout<<"fa="<<fa<<endl;
        }
    };
class second :public first
{
int sa;
public :
second (int a) : first (a%10), sa(a/10)
    {
    cout<<"Con of second called"<<endl;
    }
    void sshow( )
        {
        fshow( );
        cout<<"sa="<<sa<<endl;
        }
    };
int main( )
    {
    second s(234);
    s.sshow( );
    }
~~~
~~~
Output:
Con of first called
Con of second called
fa=4
sa=23
