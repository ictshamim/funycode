## Friend Function in C++
A friend function is totally a new concept in C++. As the name implies it will be a friend someone. We can make a function as a friend of a class and can allow that friend function to access private and public data members of that class. Friend functions are mostly used where two or more classes want to share a common function. We present a number of points about friend functions.

- First of all friend is keyword. A friend function is created by placing the keyword friend in the function declaration but not in function definition. Exception is if you declare and define at the same place.
- A friend function is a friend of the class in which it is declared.
- A friend function is not a member function of the class and cannot be called from any object of the class using dot operator.
- A friend function can have full access to the public, private and protected data member of the class to which it is a friend.
- The arguments of friend functions are usually objects of the class to which it is a friend.
- A friend function not being a member function of class is called as a normal function.
- A friend function can be friend of more than one class.
- A function of one class can be a friend of another class.
- We can have whole class as a friend of another class
- We use friend function usually with multiple classes but can used with single class also.
- A friend function can be declared in the public or private visibility mode without affecting its meaning.
- There can be any number of friend functions of a class.
- The general syntax of creating a friend function as a friend class is :
~~~js
class demo
    {
    data members :
    public :
    members functions;
    // friend function declaration
    friend data_type function_name (parameters);
    };
data_type function_name (parameters)
//definition
    {
    function definition;
    }
~~~

## Demerits of Friend Function
- Friend function cannot access the class members and functions directly, they need to have a class object which using dot can call the members of the class.
- Creating friend classes and functions defy the idea of encapsulation and create exception in the ways of data hiding.
- Usages of many friend functions some times make you think to redesign your program.
- Friend functions are conceptually messy and potentially lead to spaghetti-code situations as numerous friend functions muddy the clear boundaries between classes.

### Example-1: Write a C++ program to find the square of a number using friend function.
~~~js
//Write a C++ program to find the square of a number using friend function.
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class demo
    {
    int fx;
    public :
    void inputf(int x)
        {
        fx=x;
        }
    friend int findsqr(demo);
    };
int findsqr(demo d)
    {
    return d.fx * d.fx;
    }
int main( )
    {
    demo F;
    F.inputf(30);
    cout<<"Square is="<<findsqr(F);
    }
~~~
~~~
Output:
Square is=900
~~~
### Example-2: Write a C++ program to convert lower case string to uppercase using friend function and single class implementation.
~~~js
//Write a C++ program to convert lower case string to uppercase using friend function and single class implementation.
#include<iostream>
#include<string.h>
using namespace std;
class demo
    {
    char str[15];
    public :
    void inputf(char s[ ])
        {
        strcpy(str,s);
        }
    friend char* toupper(demo d)
        {
        static char temp[15];
        strcpy(temp,strupr(d.str));
        return temp;
        }
    };
int main( )
    {
    demo F;
    F.inputf("hari mohan");
    cout<<"String in upper case \n";
    cout<<toupper(F);
    };
~~~
~~~
Output:
String in upper case
HARI MOHAN
~~~
### Example-3: Write a C++ program to find the maximum number from two number of different class implementation.
~~~js
//Write a C++ program to find the maximum number from two number of different class implementation.
#include<iostream>
#include<string.h>
using namespace std;
class second;
class first
    {
    int fx;
    public :
    void inputf(int x)
        {
        fx=x;
        }
    friend void findmax(first,second);
    };
class second
    {
    int sx;
    public :
    void inputs(int x)
        {
        sx = x;
        }
    friend void findmax(first,second);
    };
void findmax(first A, second B)
    {
    if(A.fx>B.sx)
      cout<<A.fx<<"of class first is greater than "<<B.sx<<"of class second\n";
    else
     cout<<B.sx<<"of class second is greater than"<<A.fx<<"of class first\n";
    }
int main( )
    {
    first F;
    second S;
    F.inputf(40);
    S.inputs(70);
    findmax(F,S);
    }
~~~
~~~
Output:
70 of class second is greater than 40 of class first
~~~
## Example-4: Write a C++ program to implement the whole class as a friend of another class.
~~~js
//Write a C++ program to implement the whole class as a friend of another class.
#include<iostream>
#include<string.h>
using namespace std;
class second;
class first
    {
    public :
    void silly( )
        {
        cout<<"IN SILLY OF FIRST CLASS "<<endl;
        }
    friend class second;
    };
class second
    {
    public :
    void show(first s)
        {
        s.silly( );
        }
    };
int main( )
    {
    second s;
    first f;
    s.show(f);
    }
~~~
~~~
Output:
IN SILLY OF FIRST CLASS
~~~
