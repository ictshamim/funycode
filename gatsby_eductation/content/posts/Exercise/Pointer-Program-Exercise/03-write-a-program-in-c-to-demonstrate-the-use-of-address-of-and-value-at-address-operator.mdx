## C Implementation
### 3. Write a C program to demonstrate the use of &(address of) and *(value at address) operator.
```c
//Write a C program to demonstrate the use of &(address of) and *(value at address) operator.
#include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int *p;
    int a= 10;
    p= &a;

    printf("Value of variable 'a' is: %d", a);
    printf("\nValue of variable 'a' is: %d", *p); //printing the value using pointer
    printf("\nMemory Address of variable 'a' is: %p", &a); //printing the memory address using variable
    printf("\nMemory Address of variable 'a' is: %p", p); //printing the memory address using pointer
    printf("\nMemory Address of pointer 'p' is: %p", &p); //printing the memory address of pointer
}
```
### Output
```
Value of variable 'a' is: 10
Value of variable 'a' is: 10
Memory Address of variable 'a' is: 0x7ffc31d9dfd4
Memory Address of variable 'a' is: 0x7ffc31d9dfd4
Memory Address of pointer 'p' is: 0x7ffc31d9dfd8
```
## C++ Implementation
### 3. Write a C++ program to demonstrate the use of &(address of) and *(value at address) operator.
```c
//Write a C++ program to demonstrate the use of &(address of) and *(value at address) operator.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int *p;
    int a= 10;
    p= &a;

    cout<<"Value of variable 'a' is:"<< a;
    cout<<"\nValue of variable 'a' is:"<<*p; //printing the value using pointer
    cout<<"\nMemory Address of variable 'a' is:"<< &a; //printing the memory address using variable
    cout<<"\nMemory Address of variable 'a' is: "<< p; //printing the memory address using pointer
    cout<<"\nMemory Address of pointer 'p' is: "<<&p; //printing the memory address of pointer

}
```
### Output
```
Value of variable 'a' is: 10
Value of variable 'a' is: 10
Memory Address of variable 'a' is: 0x7ffc31d9dfd4
Memory Address of variable 'a' is: 0x7ffc31d9dfd4
Memory Address of pointer 'p' is: 0x7ffc31d9dfd8
```
