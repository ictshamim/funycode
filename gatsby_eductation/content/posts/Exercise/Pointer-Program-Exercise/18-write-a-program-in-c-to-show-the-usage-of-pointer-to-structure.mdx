## C Implementation
### 18. Write a C program to show the usage of pointer to structure.
```c
//Write a C program to show the usage of pointer to structure.
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    struct student
    {
        char *name;
        char address[1000];
        int ID;
    }
    student= {"abcde","Rajshahi",12345},*p=&student;
    printf(" Name=%s    Address=%s   ID=%d ",p->name,(*p).address,(*p).ID);
    return 0;
}
```
### Output
```
Address of variable 'a' is: 0x7ffcdc9c3f64
```
## C++ Implementation
### 18. Write a C++ program to show the usage of pointer to structure.
```c
//Write a C++ program to show the usage of pointer to structure.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
#include <iostream>
#include <string.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    struct student
    {
        char *name;
        char address[1000];
        int ID;
    }
    student= {"abcde","Rajshahi",12345},*p=&student;
    cout<<" Name="<<p->name<< " \n Address="<<(*p).address<<"\n ID= "<<(*p).ID;
    return 0;
}
```
### Output
```
Address of variable 'a' is: 0x7ffcdc9c3f64
```
