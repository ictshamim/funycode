## C Implementation
### 1. Write a C program to show the basic declaration of pointer.
```c
//Write a C program to show the basic declaration of pointer.
#include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int a=10; //Variable declaration
    int *p; //Pointer declaration
    p=&a;
    printf("Address of variable 'a' is: %p", p);
}
```
### Output
```
Address of variable 'a' is: 0x7ffcdc9c3f64
```
## C++ Implementation
### 1. Write a C++ program to show the basic declaration of pointer.
```c
//Write a C++ program to show the basic declaration of pointer.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a=10; //Variable declaration
    int *p;   //Pointer declaration
    p=&a;
    cout<<"Address of variable 'a' is: <<" <<p;
}

```
### Output
```
Address of variable 'a' is: 0x7ffcdc9c3f64
```
