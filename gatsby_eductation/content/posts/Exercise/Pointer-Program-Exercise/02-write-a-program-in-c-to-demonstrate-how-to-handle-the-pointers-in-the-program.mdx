## C Implementation
### 2. Write a C program to demonstrate how to handle the pointers in the program.
```c
//Write a C program to demonstrate how to handle the pointers in the program.
#include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
   int *p;
   int m;
   m=2;
   printf(" Value of m = %d\n",m);
   printf("Memory Address of m = %p\n\n",&m); //printing Memory Address of m using variable

   p=&m;
   printf(" Content of pointer p : %d\n",*p); //printing the value of m using pointer
   printf("Memory Address of pointer p : %p\n\n",p); //printing Memory Address of m using pointer


   m=4; //change the value of m
   printf(" Content of pointer p : %d\n",*p);  //printing the value of m using pointer
   printf("Memory Address of pointer p : %p\n\n",p); //printing Memory Address of m using pointer

   *p=9; //change the value of m by pointer
   printf(" Value of m : %d\n",m); //printing the changed value
   printf("Memory Address of m : %p\n\n",&m); //printing Memory Address of m using variable

}
```
### Output
```
 Value of m = 2
Memory Address of m = 0x7ffcf715f614

 Content of pointer p : 2
Memory Address of pointer p : 0x7ffcf715f614

 Content of pointer p : 4
Memory Address of pointer p : 0x7ffcf715f614

 Value of m : 9
Memory Address of m : 0x7ffcf715f614
```
## C++ Implementation
### 2. Write a C++ program to demonstrate how to handle the pointers in the program.
```c
//Write a C++ program to demonstrate how to handle the pointers in the program.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int *p;
    int m;
    m=2;
    cout<<" Value of m = "<<m<<endl;
    cout<<"Memory Address of m ="<<&m<<endl; //printing Memory Address of m using variable

    p=&m;
    cout<<" Content of pointer p : "<<*p<<endl; //printing the value of m using pointer
    cout<<"Memory Address of pointer p : "<<p<<endl; //printing Memory Address of m using pointer


    m=4; //change the value of m
    cout<<" Content of pointer p :"<<*p<<endl;  //printing the value of m using pointer
    cout<<"Memory Address of pointer p : "<<p<<endl; //printing Memory Address of m using pointer

    *p=9; //change the value of m by pointer
    cout<<" Value of m : "<<m<<endl; //printing the changed value
    cout<<"Memory Address of m : "<<&m<<endl; //printing Memory Address of m using variable

}



```
### Output
```
 Value of m = 2
Memory Address of m = 0x7ffcf715f614

 Content of pointer p : 2
Memory Address of pointer p : 0x7ffcf715f614

 Content of pointer p : 4
Memory Address of pointer p : 0x7ffcf715f614

 Value of m : 9
Memory Address of m : 0x7ffcf715f614
```
