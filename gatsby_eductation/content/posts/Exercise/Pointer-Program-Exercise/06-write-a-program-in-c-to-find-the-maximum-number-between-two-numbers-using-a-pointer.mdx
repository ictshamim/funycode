## C Implementation
### 6. Write a C program to find the maximum number between two numbers using a pointer.
```c
//Write a C program to find the maximum number between two numbers using a pointer.
#include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int a,b,*p1=&a,*p2=&b;
    printf("Enter two integers\n");
    scanf("%d%d", p1, p2);
    if(*p1>*p2)
        printf("\n %d is the maximum number.\n",*p1);
    else
        printf("\n %d is the maximum number.\n",*p2);
}
```
### Output
```
Enter two integers
1 2

 2 is the maximum number.
```
## C++ Implementation
### 6. Write a C++ program to find the maximum number between two numbers using a pointer.
```c
//Write a C++ program to find the maximum number between two numbers using a pointer.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a,b,*p1=&a,*p2=&b;
    cout<<("Enter two integers\n");
    cin>>*p1>> *p2;

    if(*p1>*p2)
        cout<<"\n"<<*p1<< " is the maximum number.\n";

    else
        cout<<"\n"<<*p2<< " is the maximum number.\n";
}
```
### Output
```
Enter two integers
1 2

 2 is the maximum number.
```
