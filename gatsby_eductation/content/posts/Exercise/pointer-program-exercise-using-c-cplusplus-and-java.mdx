Pointer is a variable that points to or references a memory location in which data is stored.
Each memory cell in the computer has an address that can be used to access that location so a pointer
variable points to a memory location. We can access and change the contents of this memory location
via the pointer. The pointer program list has been given bellow. All the programs have been solved in
two programming languages are C and C++. Start your journey with C and C++ programming with the pointer
program list-
