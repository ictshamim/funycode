## C Implementation
### 4. Write a C program to find arithmetic mean of two numbers.
```c
//Write a C program to find arithmetic mean of two numbers.
#include <stdio.h>
#define Mean(x,y) ((x+y)/2.0)
int main()
{
    double a,b,am;
    printf("Enter first number: ");
    scanf("%lf",&a);
    printf("Enter second number: ");
    scanf("%lf",&b);
    am = Mean(a,b);
    printf("Arithmetic Mean of 2 number is: %lf \n",am);
    return 0;
}
```
### Output
```
Enter first number: 1
Enter second number: 5
Arithmetic Mean of 2 number is: 3.000000
```

## C++ Implementation
### 4. Write a C++ program to find arithmetic mean of two numbers.
```c
//Write a C++ program to find arithmetic mean of two numbers.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{

}
```
### Output
```
Enter first number: 1
Enter second number: 5
Arithmetic Mean of 2 number is: 3.000000
```

## Java Implementation
### 4. Write a Java program to find arithmetic mean of two numbers.
```js
//Write a Java program to find arithmetic mean of two numbers.
public class Funycode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
}
```
### Output
```
Enter first number: 1
Enter second number: 5
Arithmetic Mean of 2 number is: 3.000000
```
