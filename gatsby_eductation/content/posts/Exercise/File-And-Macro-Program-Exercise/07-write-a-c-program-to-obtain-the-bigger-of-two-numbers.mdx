## C Implementation
### 7. Write a C program to obtain the bigger of two numbers.
```c
//Write a C program to obtain the bigger of two numbers.
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAX(x,y) ((x>y)?x:y)
int main()
{
    int a,b,max;
    printf("Enter first number: ");
    scanf("%d",&a);
    printf("Enter second number: ");
    scanf("%d",&b);
    max=MAX(a,b);
    printf("Maximum number is: %d\n",max);
    return 0;
}
```
### Output
```
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 8
Maximum number is: 8
```

## C++ Implementation
### 7. Write a C++ program to obtain the bigger of two numbers.
```c
//Write a C++ program to obtain the bigger of two numbers.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{

}
```
### Output
```
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 8
Maximum number is: 8
```

## Java Implementation
### 7. Write a Java program to obtain the bigger of two numbers.
```js
//Write a Java program to obtain the bigger of two numbers.
public class Funycode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
}
```
### Output
```
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 8
Maximum number is: 8
```
