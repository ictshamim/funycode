String is a sequence of characters. Any sequence or set of characters defined within double quotation
symbols is a constant string. The string exercise program list has been given bellow. All the programs have
been solved in three programming languages are C, C++ and Java. Start your journey with C, C++ and Java
programming with the string program list-
