A file is a space in a memory where data is stored. A mechanism of manipulating with the files is called as
file management. A file must be opened before performing operations on it. A file can be opened in a read,
write or an append mode. On the other hands, macro is a segment of code which is replaced by the value of
macro. Macro is defined by #define directive. The macro and file exercise program list has been given bellow.
All the programs have been solved in three programming languages are C, C++ and Java. Start your journey
with C, C++ and Java programming with the basic and expression program list-
## Macro Program Exercise List

1. [Write a C program to test whether a character entered is a small case letter or not using macro definition.](/write-a-c/c/java-program-to-test-whether-a-character-entered-is-a-small-case-letter-or-not-using-macro-definition.)

2. [Write a C program to test whether a character entered is a upper case letter or not using macro definition.](/write-a-c/c/java-program-to-test-whether-a-character-is-an-alphabet-or-not-using-macro-definition.)

3. [Write a C program to test whether a character is an alphabet or not using macro definition.](/write-a-c/c/java-program-to-test-whether-a-character-entered-is-a-small-case-letter-or-not-using-macro-definition.)

4. [Write a C program to obtain the bigger of two numbers using macro definition.](/write-a-c/c/java-program-to-obtain-the-bigger-of-two-numbers.)

5. [Write a C program to find arithmetic mean of two numbers.](/write-a-c/c/java-program-to-find-arithmetic-mean-of-two-numbers.)

6. Write a C program to find absolute value of a number.

7. [Write a C program to convert a uppercase alphabet to lowercase.](/write-a-c/c/java-program-to-convert-a-uppercase-alphabet-to-lowercase.)

8. Write a C program to obtain the bigger of two numbers.

5. Write a program in C to Find the Number of Lines in a Text File

6. Write a program in C to find the content of the file and number of lines in a Text File.

7. Write a program in C to count a number of words and characters in a file.

8. Write a program in C to delete a specific line from a file.

9. Write a program in C to replace a specific line with another text in a file.

10. Write a program in C to append multiple lines at the end of a text file.

11. Write a program in C to copy a file in another name.

12. Write a program in C to merge two files and write it in a new file.

13. Write a program in C to encrypt a text file.

14. Write a program in C to decrypt a previously encrypted file.

15. Write a program in C to remove a file from the disk.

16. Write a program to read name and marks of n number of students and store them in a file.

17. Write a program read name and marks of n number of students from and store them in a file. If the file previously exits, add the information to the file.

18. Write a program to write all the members of an array of structures to a file using fwrite(). Read the array from the file and display on the screen.
