Switch statement is one of decision-making control-flow statements. It tests the value of an expression
against a list of integer or character constants. When a match is found the statements associated with that
constants are executed. The conditional operator is also known as a ternary operator. The conditional
statements are the decision-making statements which depends upon the output of the expression.
It is represented by two symbols, i.e., '?' and ':'. The switch and conditional operator exercise program
list has been given bellow. All the programs have been solved in three programming languages are C, C++ and
Java. Start your journey with C, C++ and Java programming with the switch and conditional operator program
list-
