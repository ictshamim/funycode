## C Implementation
### 10. Write a C program to find maximum and minimum between two numbers using functions.
```c
//Write a C program to find maximum and minimum between two numbers using functions.
#include<stdio.h>

int maximum(int a, int b)
{
    if(a > b)
      printf("Maximum number is %d", a);
    else
      printf("Maximum number is %d", b);
}

int main()
{
    int n1, n2;
    printf("Enter two number: ");
    scanf("%d",&n1);
    scanf("%d",&n2);
    if(n1==n2)
      printf("You have entered same number");
    else
      maximum(n1,n2);
}
```
### Output
```
Enter two number: 3 4
Maximum number is 4
```

## C++ Implementation
### 10. Write a C++ program to find maximum and minimum between two numbers using functions.
```c
//Write a C++ program to find maximum and minimum between two numbers using functions.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int maximum(int a, int b)
{
    if(a > b)
      cout << "Maximum number is " << a;
    else
      cout << "Maximum number is " << b;
}
int main()
{
    int n1, n2;
    printf("Enter two number: ");
    cin >> n1 >> n2;
    if(n1==n2)
      cout << "You have entered same number";
    else
      maximum(n1,n2);
}
```
### Output
```
Enter two number: 3 4
Maximum number is 4
```

## Java Implementation
### 2. Write a Java program to find the square of any number using the function.
```js
//Write a Java program to show the simple structure of a function.
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Funycode {
    static int maximum(int a, int b)
    {
        if(a > b)
          System.out.println("Maximum number is "+ a);
        else
          System.out.println("Maximum number is "+ b);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner z = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n1, n2;
        System.out.println("Enter two number: ");
        n1 = z.nextInt();
        n2 = z.nextInt();
        if(n1==n2)
          System.out.println("You have entered same number");
        else
          maximum(n1,n2);
    }
}
```
### Output
```
Enter two number: 3 4
Maximum number is 4
```
