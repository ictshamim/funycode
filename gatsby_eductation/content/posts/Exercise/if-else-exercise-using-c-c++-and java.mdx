The If – else statement contains a condition. It is logically evaluated. In an if…else statement, if the code
in the parenthesis of the if statement is true, the code inside its brackets is executed.
But if the statement inside the parenthesis is false, all the code within the else statement’s brackets is
executed instead. Else clause is optional. The if-else exercise program list has been given bellow.
All the programs have been solved in three programming languages are C, C++ and Java.
Start your journey with C, C++ and Java programming with the if-else program list-
