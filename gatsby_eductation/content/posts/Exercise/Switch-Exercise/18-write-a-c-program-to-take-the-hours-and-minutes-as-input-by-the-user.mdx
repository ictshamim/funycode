## C Implementation
### 18. Write a C program to take the hours and minutes as input by the user and the show that whether it is AM or PM by using the switch.
```c
//Write a C program to find all the roots of a quadratic equation using switch.
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int h,m;
    printf("input Hours : ");
    scanf("%d",&h);
    printf("Input Minutes : ");
    scanf("%d",&m);
    switch(h>=12 && h<=24)
    {
    case 1:
        printf("The time is in PM ");
        break;
    case 0:
        switch (h>=0 && h<=11)
        {
        case 1:
            printf("Time is in AM ");
            break;
        case 0:
            printf("Wrong");
            break;
        }
        break;
    }
}
```
### Output
```
input Hours : 12
Input Minutes : 32
The time is in PM
```

## C++ Implementation
### 18. Write a C++ program to take the hours and minutes as input by the user and the show that whether it is AM or PM by using the switch.
```c
//Write a C++ program to take the hours and minutes as input by the user and the show that whether it is AM or PM by using the switch.
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int h,m;
    cout << "input Hours : ";
    cin >> h;
    cout << "Input Minutes : ";
    cin >> m;
    switch(h>=12 && h<=24)
    {
    case 1:
        cout << "The time is in PM ";
        break;
    case 0:
        switch (h>=0 && h<=11)
        {
        case 1:
            cout << "Time is in AM ";
            break;
        case 0:
            cout << "Wrong";
            break;
        }
        break;
    }
}
```
### Output
```
input Hours : 12
Input Minutes : 32
The time is in PM
```

## Java Implementation
### 18. Write a Java program to take the hours and minutes as input by the user and the show that whether it is AM or PM by using the switch.
```js
////Write a C++ program to take the hours and minutes as input by the user and the show that whether it is AM or PM by using the switch.
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Funycode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      int h,m;
      System.out.println("input Hours : ");
      Scanner z = new Scanner(System.in);
      h = z.nextInt();
      System.out.println("Input Minutes : ");
      m = z.nextInt();
      switch(h>=12 && h<=24)
      {
      case 1:
          System.out.println("The time is in PM ");
          break;
      case 0:
          switch (h>=0 && h<=11)
          {
          case 1:
              System.out.println("Time is in AM ");
              break;
          case 0:
              System.out.println("Wrong");
              break;
          }
          break;
      }
    }
}
```
### Output
```
input Hours : 12
Input Minutes : 32
The time is in PM
```
