## C Implementation
### 11. Write a C program accept the details of employee and display them using structure. Details consist of Employee ID, Name, Designation, Department, Salary.
```c
//Write a C++ program accept the details of employee and display them using structure. Details consist of Employee ID, Name, Designation, Department, Salary.
#include<stdio.h>
struct employee{
    char name[100];
    int id;
    char Designation[20];
    char Department[50];
    float Salary;
};
int main(){
    struct employee emp1;
    printf("input employee details\n");
    printf("Enter employee Name: ");
    fgets(emp1.name,sizeof(emp1.name),stdin);
    printf("Enter employee ID: ");
    scanf("%d",&emp1.id);
    getchar();
    printf("Enter employee Designation: ");
    fgets(emp1.Designation,sizeof(emp1.Designation),stdin);
    printf("Enter employee Department: ");
    fgets(emp1.Department,sizeof(emp1.Department),stdin);
    printf("Enter employee Salary: ");
    scanf("%f",&emp1.Salary);
    printf("\n\nEmployee Details:\n");
    printf("Name        : %s",emp1.name);
    printf("ID          : %d\n",emp1.id);
    printf("Designation : %s",emp1.Designation);
    printf("Department  : %s",emp1.Department);
    printf("Salary      : %f\n",emp1.Salary);
}
```
### Output
```
input employee details
Enter employee Name: Ahosanul Hasan
Enter employee ID: 16105001
Enter employee Designation: Funycode
Enter employee Department: Programming
Enter employee Salary: 110000


Employee Details:
Name        : Ahosanul Hasan

ID          : 16105001
Designation : Funycode

Department  : Programming

Salary      : 110000
```

## C++ Implementation

    cin >> emp1.id;
    getchar();
    cout << "Enter employee Designation: ";
    fgets(emp1.Designation,sizeof(emp1.Designation),stdin);
    cout << "Enter employee Department: ";
    fgets(emp1.Department,sizeof(emp1.Department),stdin);
    cout << "Enter employee Salary: ";
    cin >> emp1.Salary;
    cout << "\n\nEmployee Details:\n";
    cout << "Name        : "<< emp1.name << endl;
    cout << "ID          : "<< emp1.id << endl;
    cout << "Designation : "<< emp1.Designation << endl;
    cout << "Department  : "<< emp1.Department << endl;
    cout << "Salary      : "<< emp1.Salary << endl;
}
```
