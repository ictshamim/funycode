## C Implementation
### 12. Write a C program to read the details of two workers and calculate total payment of workers using structure.
```c
//Write a C++ program to read the details of two workers and calculate total payment of workers using structure.
#include<stdio.h>
struct workers{
    char name[50];
    int salaryPerDay;
    int totalDay;
};
int main(){
    struct workers a;
    printf("Enter first employee details\n");
    printf("employee name : ");
    fgets(a.name,sizeof(a.name),stdin);
    printf("salary per day : ");
    scanf("%d",&a.salaryPerDay);
    printf("total working days : ");
    scanf("%d",&a.totalDay);
    getchar();
    int total1=(a.salaryPerDay*a.totalDay);
    struct workers b;
    printf("Enter second employee details\n");
    printf("employee name : ");
    fgets(b.name,sizeof(b.name),stdin);
    printf("salary per day : ");
    scanf("%d",&b.salaryPerDay);
    printf("total working days : ");
    scanf("%d",&b.totalDay);
    int total2=(b.salaryPerDay*b.totalDay);
    printf(" first employee details\n");
    printf("name: %s",a.name);
    printf("Total Salary %d \n",total1);
    printf(" second employee details\n");
    printf("name: %s",b.name);
    printf("Total Salary %d",total2);
}
```
### Output
```
Enter first employee details

employee name :Ahosanul Hasan
salary per day :30
total working days :20

Enter second employee details

employee name :Hossain
salary per day :50
total working days : 25

first employee details
name: Ahosanul Hasan

Total Salary 600 second employee details
name: Hossain
Total Salary 1250
```

## C++ Implementation
### 12. Write a C++ program to read the details of two workers and calculate total payment of workers using structure.
```c
//Write a C++ program to read the details of two workers and calculate total payment of workers using structure.

#include<iostream>
#include <string.h>
using namespace std;
struct workers{
    char name[50];
    int salaryPerDay;
    int totalDay;
};
int main(){
    struct workers a;
    cout << "Enter first employee details\n"<< endl;
    cout << "employee name : "<< endl;
    fgets(a.name,sizeof(a.name),stdin);
    cout << "salary per day : "<< endl;
    cin >> a.salaryPerDay;
    cout << "total working days : "<< endl;
    cin >> a.totalDay;
    getchar();
    int total1=(a.salaryPerDay*a.totalDay);
    struct workers b;
    cout << "Enter second employee details\n"<< endl;
    cout << "employee name : "<< endl;
    fgets(b.name,sizeof(b.name),stdin);
    cout << "salary per day : "<< endl;
    cin >> b.salaryPerDay;
    cout << "total working days : "<< endl;
    cin >> b.totalDay;
    int total2=(b.salaryPerDay*b.totalDay);
    cout << " first employee details\n"<< endl;
    cout << "name: "<<a.name<< endl;
    cout << "Total Salary " << total1);
    cout << " second employee details\n"<< endl;
    cout << "name: " << b.name<< endl;
    cout << "Total Salary << total2;
}
```
### Output
```
Enter first employee details

employee name :Ahosanul Hasan
salary per day :30
total working days :20

Enter second employee details

employee name :Hossain
salary per day :50
total working days : 25

first employee details
name: Ahosanul Hasan

Total Salary 600 second employee details
name: Hossain
Total Salary 1250
```
