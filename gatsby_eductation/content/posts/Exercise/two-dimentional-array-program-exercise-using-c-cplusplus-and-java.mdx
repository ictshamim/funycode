A two-dimensional array is similar to a one-dimensional array, but it can be visualised as a grid (or table)
with rows and columns. A large number of exercise and solution in two-dimensional array has been completed using C, C++ and
Java. Start your journey in two-dimensional array with C,C++ and Java programming languages.
