## C Implementation
### 15. Write a C program to compute the perimeter and area of a rectangle with a height of 7 inches. and width of 5 inches.
```c
/*Write a C program to compute the perimeter and area of a rectangle with a height of 7 inches. and width of 5 inches.*/
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int a,b;
    a=2*(5+7);
    b=5*7;
    printf("Area=%d",b);
    printf("Perameter=%d\n",a);

}
```
### Output
```
Area=35.0
Perimeter=24
```
## C++ Implementation
### 15. Write a C++ program to compute the perimeter and area of a rectangle with a height of 7 inches. and width of 5 inches.
```c
/*Write a C++ program to compute the perimeter and area of a rectangle with a height of 7 inches. and width of 5 inches.*/
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a=7,b=5,p;
    float c;
    c=(7*5);
    p=2*(5+7);
    cout<<"area:"<<c;
    cout<<"Perimeter"<<p;
    return 0;
}
```
### Output
```
Area=35.0
Perimeter=24
```
## Java Implementation
### 15. Write a Java program to compute the perimeter and area of a rectangle with a height of 7 inches. and width of 5 inches.
```js
/*Write a java program to compute the perimeter and area of a rectangle with a height of 7 inches. and width of 5 inches.*/
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Funycode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int a=7,b=5;
        float c; c=(7*5)/2;
        System.out.println(c);
    }
}
```
### Output
```
Area=35.0
Perimeter=24
```
