## C Implementation
### Program-17: Ramesh’s basic salary is input through the keyboard. His dearness allowance is 40% of basic salary, and house rent allowance is 20% of basic salary. Write a program to calculate his gross salary.
```c
/*Ramesh’s basic salary is input through the keyboard. His dearness allowance is 40% of basic salary, and house rent allowance is 20% of basic salary. Write a program to calculate his gross salary.*/
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int s,r;
    scanf("%d",&s);
    r=(s+(s*20)/100+(s*40)/100);
    printf("Gross Salary=%d",r);
}
```
### Output
```
2000
Gross Salary=3200
```

```js
/*Ramesh’s basic salary is input through the keyboard. His dearness allowance is 40% of basic salary, and house rent allowance is 20% of basic salary. Write a java program to calculate his gross salary.*/
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Funycode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int s,r;
        Scanner z=new Scanner(System.in);
        s=z.nextInt();
        r=(s+(s*20)/100+(s*40)/100);
        System.out.println("Gross Salary="+r);
    }
}
