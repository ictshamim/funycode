## C Implementation
### Program-9: Write a C program that will take three numbers from user and find their average.
```c
//Write a C program to print Hello World.
/*Write a C program that will take three numbers from user and find their average. */
#include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int a,b,c,d;
    scanf("%d%d%d",&a,&b,&c);
    d=(a+b+c)/3;
    printf("%d",d);
}
```
### Output
```
Input: 3
       6
       9
Output: 6
```
## C++ Implementation
### Program-9: Write a C++ program that will take three numbers from user and find their average.
```c
/*Write a complete C++ Program to input any Capital letter and display it with small letter. */
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a,b,c,d;
    cin >> a >> b >> c;
    d=(a+b+c)/3;
    cout << d;
}
```
### Output
```
Input: 3
6
9 Output: 6
```
## Java Implementation
### Program-8: Write a complete Java Program to input any Capital letter and display it with small letter.
```js
/*Write a Java program that will take three numbers from user and find their average. */
public class Funycode {
      int a,b,c,d;
      Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
      a=sc.nextInt();
      b=sc.nextInt();
      c=sc.nextInt();
      d=(a+b+c)/3;

      System.out.println(d);
}
```
### Output
```
Input:
3
6
9
Output: 6
```
