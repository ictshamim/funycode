## C Implementation
### Program-29:If a four-digit number is input through the keyboard, write a C program to obtain the sum of the first and last digit of this number. (without loop)
```c
/*If a four-digit number is input through the keyboard, write a C program to obtain the sum of the first and last digit of this number. (without loop)*/
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int n,s=0,f,l;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    l=n%10;
    f=n/1000;
    s=l+f;
    printf("Sum of First and Last Digit is=%d",s);
}
```
### Output
```
1234
Sum of First and Last Digit is :=5
```

## C++ Implementation
### Program-29:If a four-digit number is input through the keyboard, write a C++ program to obtain the sum of the first and last digit of this number. (without loop)
```c
/*If a four-digit number is input through the keyboard, write a C++ program to obtain the sum of the first and last digit of this number. (without loop)*/
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int n,s=0,f,l;
    cin>>n;
    l=n%10;
    f=n/1000;
    s=l+f;
    cout<<"Sum of First and Last Digit is"<<s;
}
```
### Output
```
1234
Sum of First and Last Digit is :=5
```

## Java Implementation
### Program-29:If a four-digit number is input through the keyboard, write a java program to obtain the sum of the first and last digit of this number. (without loop)
```js
//If a four-digit number is input through the keyboard, write a java program to obtain the sum of the first and last digit of this number. (without loop)
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Funycode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner z=new Scanner(System.in);
        int n,s=0,f,l;
        n=z.nextInt();
        l=n%10;
        f=n/1000;
        s=l+f;
        System.out.println("Sum of First and Last Digit is :="+s);

    }

}
```
### Output
```
1234
Sum of First and Last Digit is :=5
```
