## C Implementation
### Program-19: Write a C program that takes hours and minutes as input, and calculates the total number of minutes.
```c
/*Write a C program that takes hours and minutes as input, and calculates the total number of minutes.*/
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int a,b,c;
    scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
    c=a*60+b;
    printf("total minute=%d",c);
}
```
### Output
```
10
20
Total Minute=620
```

## C++ Implementation
### Program-19: Write a C++ program that takes hours and minutes as input, and calculates the total number of minutes.
```c
/*Write a C++ program that takes hours and minutes as input, and calculates the total number of minutes.*/
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a,b,c;
    cin>>a>>b;
    c=a*60+b;
    cout<<"Total Minute:"<<c;
    return 0;
}
```
### Output
```
10
20
Total Minute:620
```

## Java Implementation
### Program-19: Write a Java program that takes hours and minutes as input, and calculates the total number of minutes.
```js
/*Write a Java program that takes hours and minutes as input, and calculates the total number of minutes.*/
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Funycode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int a,b,c;
        Scanner z=new Scanner(System.in);
        a=z.nextInt();
        b=z.nextInt();
        c=a*60+b;
        System.out.println("Total Minute::="+c);
    }
}
```
### Output
```
10
20
Total Minute::=620
```
