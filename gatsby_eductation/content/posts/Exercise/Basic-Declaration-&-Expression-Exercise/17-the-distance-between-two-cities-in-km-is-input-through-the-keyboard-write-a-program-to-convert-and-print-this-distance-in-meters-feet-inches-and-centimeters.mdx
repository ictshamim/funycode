## C Implementation
### Program-18: The distance between two cities (in km.) is input through the keyboard. Write a program to convert and print this distance in meters, feet, inches and centimeters.
```c
/*The distance between two cities (in km.) is input through the keyboard. Write a C program to convert and print this distance in meters, feet, inches and centimeters.*/
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int a;
    float b,c,d,e;
    scanf("%d",&a);
    b=a*1000;
    c=b*100;
    d=c*0.032;
    e=d*12;
    printf("meter=%f Centimeter=%f Feet=%f Inches=%f",b,c,d,e);
}
```
### Output
```
1000
Meter:=1000000.0
Centimeter=1.0E8
Feet=3200000.0
Inches=3.84E7
```

## C++ Implementation
### Program-18: The distance between two cities (in km.) is input through the keyboard. Write a C++ program to convert and print this distance in meters, feet, inches and centimeters.
```c
/*The distance between two cities (in km.) is input through the keyboard. Write a C++ program to convert and print this distance in meters, feet, inches and centimeters.*/
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a;
    double b,c,d,e;
    cin>>a;
    b=a*1000;
    c=b*100;
    d=c*0.032;
    e=d*12;
    cout<<"Meter:"<<b<<endl;
    cout<<"Centimeter:"<<c<<endl;
    cout<<"Feet:"<<d<<endl;
    cout<<"Inches:"<<e;
    return 0;
}
```
### Output
```
1000
Meter:=1000000.0
Centimeter=1.0E8
Feet=3200000.0
Inches=3.84E7
```

## Java Implementation
### Program-18: The distance between two cities (in km.) is input through the keyboard. Write a Java program to convert and print this distance in meters, feet, inches and centimeters.
```js
/*The distance between two cities (in km.) is input through the keyboard. Write a Java program to convert and print this distance in meters, feet, inches and centimeters.*/
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Funycode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int a;
        double b,c,d,e;
        Scanner z=new Scanner(System.in);
        a=z.nextInt();
        b=a*1000;
        c=b*100;
        d=c*0.032;
        e=d*12;
        System.out.println("Meter:="+b);
        System.out.println("Centimeter="+c);
        System.out.println("Feet="+d);
        System.out.println("Inches"+e);
    }
}
```
### Output
```
1000
Meter:=1000000.0
Centimeter=1.0E8
Feet=3200000.0
Inches3.84E7
```
