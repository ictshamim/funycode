## C Implementation
### Program-30: In a town, the percentage of men is 52. The percentage of total literacy is 48. If total percentage of literate men is 35 of the total population, write a C  program to find the total number of illiterate men and women if the population of the town is 80,000.
```c
/*In a town, the percentage of men is 52. The percentage of total literacy is 48. If total percentage of literate men is 35 of the total population, write a c program to find the total number of illiterate men and women if the population of the town is 80,000.*/
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k;
    a=80000;
    b=52;
    c=35;
    d=48;
    e=(b*a)/100;
    f=(a-e);
    printf("Total Man=%d\n",e);
    printf("Total Women=%d\n",f);
    g=(c*e)/100;
    h=(e-g);
    printf("illiterates Man=%d\n",h);
    i=(d-c);
    j=(i*f)/100;
    k=f-j;
    printf("illiterates Women=%d\n",k);
}
```
### Output
```
Total Man:41600
Total Woman:38400
Illiterates Man:27040
Illiterates Woman:41600
```

## C++ Implementation

    j=(i*f)/100;
    k=f-j;
    cout<<"illitarate woman:"<<k<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```
### Output
```
Total Man:41600
Total Woman:38400
Illiterates Man:27040
Illiterates Woman:41600
```

## Java Implementation
### Program-30: In a town, the percentage of men is 52. The percentage of total literacy is 48. If total percentage of literate men is 35 of the total population, write a java  program to find the total number of illiterate men and women if the population of the town is 80,000.
```js
/*In a town, the percentage of men is 52. The percentage of total literacy is 48. If total percentage of literate men is 35 of the total population, write a java program to find the total number of illiterate men and women if the population of the town is 80,000.*/

```
### Output
```
