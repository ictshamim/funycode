## C Implementation
### 33. Write a C program to count of each character in a given string.
```c
//Write a C program to count of each character in a given string.
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>
int main()
{
    char string[100];
    printf("Enter the string: ");
    gets(string);
    int len = strlen(string);
    int i,a[30]={0};
    for(i=0;i<len;i++){
        if(string[i]<92)
        a[string[i]-65]++;
        else
        a[string[i]-97]++;}
    for(i=0;i<26;i++){
        if(a[i]>0)
        printf("%c is appeared %d times\n",i+65, a[i]);
    }
}
```
### Output
```
Enter the string: hello world
69 is appeared 1 times
72 is appeared 1 times
76 is appeared 2 times
79 is appeared 1 times
```
## C++ Implementation
### 33. Write a C++ program to count of each character in a given string.
```c
//Write a C++ program to count of each character in a given string.

#include <iostream>
#include <string.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    char string[100];
    printf("Enter the string: ");
    cin >> string;
    int len = strlen(string);
    int i,a[30]={0};
    for(i=0;i<len;i++){
        if(string[i]<92)
        a[string[i]-65]++;
        else
        a[string[i]-97]++;}
    for(i=0;i<26;i++){
        if(a[i]>0)
        cout << i+65 << " is appeared " << a[i] << " times\n";
    }
}
```
### Output
```
Enter the string: hello world
69 is appeared 1 times
72 is appeared 1 times
76 is appeared 2 times
79 is appeared 1 times
```

## Java Implementation
### 33. Write a Java program to count of each character in a given string.
```js
//Write a Java program to count of each character in a given string.
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Funycode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner z=new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter the string: ");
        String string = z.nextLine();
        int len = string.length() -1;
        int i;
        int[] a = new int[100];
        for(i=0;i<len;i++){
            if(string.charAt(i)<92)
                a[string.charAt(i)-65]++;
            else
                a[string.charAt(i)-97]++;}
        for(i=0;i<26;i++){
            if(a[i]>0)
                System.out.println(i+65+" is appeared " + a[i] + "times\n");
        }
    }
}
```
### Output
```
Enter the string: hello world
69 is appeared 1 times
72 is appeared 1 times
76 is appeared 2 times
79 is appeared 1 times
```
