## C Implementation
### 37. Write a C program to count the number of occurrences of any two vowels in succession in a line of text. For example, in the sentence “Pleases read this application and give me gratuity” such occurrences are ea, ea, ui
```c
//Write a C program to count the number of occurrences of any two vowels in succession in a line of text. For example, in the sentence “Pleases read this application and give me gratuity” such occurrences are ea, ea, ui
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
void main()
{
    char a[10000],i=0,count=0;
    printf("enter the line: ");
    gets(a);
    printf("two vowels in succesion are: ");
    while(a[i]!='\0')
    {
        if(a[i]=='a'|| a[i]=='e'|| a[i]=='i'|| a[i]=='o'||a[i]=='u' )
        {
            if(a[i+1]=='a'|| a[i+1]=='e'|| a[i+1]=='i'|| a[i+1]=='o'|| a[i+1]=='u')
            {
                count++;
                printf("%c%c  ",a[i],a[i+1]);
            }
        }
        i++;
    }
    printf("\noccurence of two vowels in succesion = %2d\n ",count);
}
```
### Output
```
enter the line: hello funycode
two vowels in succesion are:
occurence of two vowels in succesion =  0
```
## C++ Implementation
### 37. Write a C++ program to count the number of occurrences of any two vowels in succession in a line of text. For example, in the sentence “Pleases read this application and give me gratuity” such occurrences are ea, ea, ui
```c
//Write a C++ program to count the number of occurrences of any two vowels in succession in a line of text. For example, in the sentence “Pleases read this application and give me gratuity” such occurrences are ea, ea, ui

#include <iostream>
#include <string.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    char a[10000],i=0,count=0;
    cout << "enter the line: ";
    cin >> a;
    cout << "two vowels in succesion are: ";
    while(a[i]!='\0')
    {
        if(a[i]=='a'|| a[i]=='e'|| a[i]=='i'|| a[i]=='o'||a[i]=='u' )
        {
            if(a[i+1]=='a'|| a[i+1]=='e'|| a[i+1]=='i'|| a[i+1]=='o'|| a[i+1]=='u')
            {
                count++;
                cout << a[i] << a[i+1] << " ";
            }
        }
        i++;
    }
    cout << "\noccurence of two vowels in succesion = " count << endl;
}
```
### Output
```
enter the line: hello funycode
two vowels in succesion are:
occurence of two vowels in succesion =  0
```

## Java Implementation
### 37. Write a Java program to count the number of occurrences of any two vowels in succession in a line of text. For example, in the sentence “Pleases read this application and give me gratuity” such occurrences are ea, ea, ui
```js
//Write a Java program to count the number of occurrences of any two vowels in succession in a line of text. For example, in the sentence “Pleases read this application and give me gratuity” such occurrences are ea, ea, ui
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Funycode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner z = new Scanner(System.in);
        char[] a = new char[1000];
        int i = 0, count = 0;
        System.out.println("enter the line: ");
        a = z.next().toCharArray();
        System.out.println("two vowels in succesion are: ");
        while (a[i] != '\0') {
            if (a[i] == 'a' || a[i] == 'e' || a[i] == 'i' || a[i] == 'o' || a[i] == 'u') {
                if (a[i + 1] == 'a' || a[i + 1] == 'e' || a[i + 1] == 'i' || a[i + 1] == 'o' || a[i + 1] == 'u') {
                    count++;
                    System.out.println(a[i] + a[i + 1] + " ");
                }
            }
            i++;
        }
        System.out.println("\noccurence of two vowels in succesion = \n "+ count);
    }
}
```
### Output
```
enter the line: hello funycode
two vowels in succesion are:
occurence of two vowels in succesion =  0
```
