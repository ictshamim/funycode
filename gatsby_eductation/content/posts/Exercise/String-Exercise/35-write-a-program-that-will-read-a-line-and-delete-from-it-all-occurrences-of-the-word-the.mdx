## C Implementation
### 35. Write a C program that will read a line and delete from it all occurrences of the word ‘the’.
```c
//Write a C program that will read a line and delete from it all occurrences of the word ‘the’.
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>
int main()
{
    char str[100];
    gets(str);
    int len= strlen(str);
    int i;
    for(i=0;i<len;i++)
    {
        if((i==0 || str[i-1]==' ')&&str[i]=='t' && str[i+1]=='h' && str[i+2]=='e' && (str[i+3]==' '|| str[i+3]=='\0') )
            i=i+3;
        printf("%c",str[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```
### Output
```
boys walks through the jungle
boys walks through jungle
```
## C++ Implementation
### 35. Write a C++ program that will read a line and delete from it all occurrences of the word ‘the’.
```c
//Write a C++ program that will read a line and delete from it all occurrences of the word ‘the’.

#include <iostream>
#include <string.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    char str[100];
    cin >> str;
    int len= strlen(str);
    int i;
    for(i=0;i<len;i++)
    {
        if((i==0 || str[i-1]==' ')&&str[i]=='t' && str[i+1]=='h' && str[i+2]=='e' && (str[i+3]==' '|| str[i+3]=='\0') )
            i=i+3;
        cout << str[i];
    }
}
```
### Output
```
boys walks through the jungle
boys walks through jungle
```

## Java Implementation
### 35. Write a Java program that will read a line and delete from it all occurrences of the word ‘the’.
```js
//Write a Java program that will read a line and delete from it all occurrences of the word ‘the’.
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Funycode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner z=new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter  the string : ");
        String str = z.nextLine();
        String str_new = str.replace("the", ' ');
        System.out.println(str_new);
    }
}
```
### Output
```
boys walks through the jungle
boys walks through jungle
```
