## C Implementation
### 26. Write a C program to find first occurrence of a word in a given string.
```c
//Write a C program to find first occurrence of a word in a given string.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
    char str[50], word[50];
    int i, index, found = 0;
    printf("Enter any string: ");
    gets(str);
    printf("Enter word to  search: ");
    gets(word);
    index = 0;
    while(str[index] != '\0')
    {
        if(str[index] == word[0])
        {
            i=0;
            found = 1;
            while(word[i] != '\0')
            {
                if(str[index + i] != word[i])
                {
                    found = 0;
                    break;
                }

                i++;
            }
        }
        if(found == 1)
        {
            break;
        }

        index++;
    }
    if(found == 1)
    {
        printf("\n'%s' is found at index %d.", word, index);
    }
    else
    {
        printf("\n'%s' is not found.", word);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
### Output
```
Enter any string: Hello how are you
Enter word to  search: you

'you' is found at index 14.
```
## C++ Implementation
### 26. Write a C++ program to find first occurrence of a word in a given string.
```c
//Write a C++ program to find first occurrence of a word in a given string.

#include <iostream>
#include <string.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    char str[50], word[50];
    int i, index, found = 0;
    cout << "Enter any string: ";
    cin >> str;
    cout << "Enter word to  search: ";
    cin >> word;
    index = 0;
    while(str[index] != '\0')
    {
        if(str[index] == word[0])
        {
            i=0;
            found = 1;
            while(word[i] != '\0')
            {
                if(str[index + i] != word[i])
                {
                    found = 0;
                    break;
                }
                i++;
            }
        }
        if(found == 1)
        {
            break;
        }

        index++;
    }
    if(found == 1)
    {
        cout << "\n" << word << " is found at index " << index;
    }
    else
    {
        cout << "\n" << word << " is not found.";
    }

    return 0;
}
```
### Output
```
Enter any string: Hello how are you
Enter word to  search: you

'you' is found at index 14.
```

## Java Implementation
### 26. Write a Java program to find first occurrence of a word in a given string.
```js
//Write a Java program to find first occurrence of a word in a given string.
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Funycode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner z=new Scanner(System.in);
        char str[50], word[50];
        int i, index, found = 0;
        System.out.println("Enter any string: ");
        str = z.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Enter word to search: ");
        word = z.nextLine();
        index = 0;
        while(str[index] != '\0')
        {
            if(str[index] == word[0])
            {
                i=0;
                found = 1;
                while(word[i] != '\0')
                {
                    if(str[index + i] != word[i])
                    {
                        found = 0;
                        break;
                    }
                    i++;
                }
            }
            if(found == 1)
            {
                break;
            }
            index++;
        }
        if(found == 1)
        {
            System.out.println(word + " is found at index "+ index);
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println(word + " is not found.");
        }
    return 0;
    }
}
```
### Output
```
Enter any string: Hello how are you
Enter word to  search: you

'you' is found at index 14.
```
