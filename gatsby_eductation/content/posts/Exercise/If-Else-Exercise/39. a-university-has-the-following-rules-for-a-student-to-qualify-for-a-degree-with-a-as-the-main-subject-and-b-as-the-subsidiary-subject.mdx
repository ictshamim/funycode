title: A university has the following rules for a student to qualify for a degree with A as the main subject and B as the subsidiary subject He should get 55 percent or more in A and 45 percent or more in B. −If he gets than 55 percent in A he should get 55 percent or more in B. However, he should get at least 45 percent in A. −If he gets less than 45 percent in B and 65 percent or more in A he is allowed to reappear in an examination in B to qualify. −In all other cases he is declared to have failed. Write a program to receive marks in A and B and Output whether the student has passed, failed or is allowed to reappear in B.

## C Implementation
### Program-39: A university has the following rules for a student to qualify for a degree with A as the main subject and B as the subsidiary subject:

### He should get 55 percent or more in A and 45 percent or more in B.
### If he gets than 55 percent in A he should get 55 percent or more in B.
### However, he should get at least 45 percent in A.
### If he gets less than 45 percent in B and 65 percent or more in A, he is allowed to reappear in an examination in B to qualify.
### In all other cases he is declared to have failed.
### Write a C program to receive marks in A and B and Output whether the student has passed, failed or is allowed to reappear in B.
```c
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int A,B;
    printf("Enter the marks of A & B-");
    scanf("%d %d",&A,&B);
    if(A>=55 && B>=45)
        printf("passed");
    else if(A>=45 && A<55 && B>=55)
        printf("passed");
    else if(A>=65 && B<45)
        printf("allow to reappear in the exam");
    else
        printf("failed");
}
```
### Output
```
Enter the marks of A & B-
60
70
passed
```

## C++ Implementation
### Program-39: A university has the following rules for a student to qualify for a degree with A as the main subject and B as the subsidiary subject:

### He should get 55 percent or more in A and 45 percent or more in B.
### If he gets than 55 percent in A he should get 55 percent or more in B.
### However, he should get at least 45 percent in A.
### If he gets less than 45 percent in B and 65 percent or more in A, he is allowed to reappear in an examination in B to qualify.
### In all other cases he is declared to have failed.
### Write a C++ program to receive marks in A and B and Output whether the student has passed, failed or is allowed to reappear in B.

```c
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int A,B;
    cout<<"enter the marks of A & B-\n";
    cin>>A>>B;
    if(A>=55 && B>=45)
        cout<<"passed";
    else if(A>=45 && A<55 && B>=55)
        cout<<"passed";
    else if(A>=65 && B<45)
        cout<<"allow to reappear in the exam";
    else
        cout<<"failed";
}
```
### Output
```
Enter the marks of A & B-
60
70
passed
```

## Java Implementation
### Program-39: A university has the following rules for a student to qualify for a degree with A as the main subject and B as the subsidiary subject:

### He should get 55 percent or more in A and 45 percent or more in B.
### If he gets than 55 percent in A he should get 55 percent or more in B.
### However, he should get at least 45 percent in A.
### If he gets less than 45 percent in B and 65 percent or more in A, he is allowed to reappear in an examination in B to qualify.
### In all other cases he is declared to have failed.
### Write a Java program to receive marks in A and B and Output whether the student has passed, failed or is allowed to reappear in B.

```js
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Funycode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner z=new Scanner(System.in);
        int A,B;
        System.out.println("enter the marks of A & B-\n");
        A=z.nextInt();
        B=z.nextInt();
        if(A>=55 && B>=45)
            System.out.println("passed");
        else if(A>=45 && A<55 && B>=55)
            System.out.println("passed");
        else if(A>=65 && B<45)
            System.out.println("allow to reappear in the exam");
        else
            System.out.println("failed");
    }
}
```
### Output
```
Enter the marks of A & B-
60
70
passed
```
