## C Implementation
### Program-38: A certain grade of steel is graded according to the following conditions

### (i)Hardness must be greater than 50
### (ii)Carbon content must be less than 0.
### (iii)Tensile strength must be greater than 5600

### The grades are as follows:
### Grade is 10 if all three conditions are met −Grade is 9 if conditions (i) and (ii) are met
### Grade is 8 if conditions (ii) and (iii) are met
### Grade is 7 if conditions (i) and (iii) are met
### Grade is 6 if only one condition is met
### Grade is 5 if none of the conditions are met

### Write a C program, which will require the user to give values of hardness, carbon content and tensile strength of the steel under consideration and output the grade of the steel.
```c
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int h,t;
    float c;
    printf("Enter the hardness, Carbon & Tensile strength-");
    scanf("%d %f %d",&h,&c,&t);
    if(h>50 && c<0.7 && t>5600)
        printf("steel grade is 10");
    else if(h>50 && c<0.7)
        printf("steel grade is 9");
    else if(c<0.7 && t>5600)
        printf("steel grade is 8");
    else if(h>50 && t>5600)
        printf("steel grade is 10");
    else if(h>50 || c<0.7 || t>5600)
        printf("steel grade is 6");
    else
        printf("steel grade is 5");
}
```
### Output
```
Enter the hardness, Carbon & Tensile strength-
4
5
6
Steel grade is 5
```

## C++ Implementation
### (i)Hardness must be greater than 50
### (ii)Carbon content must be less than 0.
### (iii)Tensile strength must be greater than 5600

### The grades are as follows:
### Grade is 10 if all three conditions are met −Grade is 9 if conditions (i) and (ii) are met
### Grade is 8 if conditions (ii) and (iii) are met
### Grade is 7 if conditions (i) and (iii) are met
### Grade is 6 if only one condition is met
### Grade is 5 if none of the conditions are met

### Write a C++ program, which will require the user to give values of hardness, carbon content and tensile strength of the steel under consideration and output the grade of the steel.

```c
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int h,t;
    float c;
    cout<<"enter the hardness,Carbon & Tensile strength-\n";
    cin>>h>>c>>t;
    if(h>50 && c<0.7 && t>5600)
        cout<<"steel grade is 10";
    else if(h>50 && c<0.7)
        cout<<"steel grade is 9";
    else if(c<0.7 && t>5600)
        cout<<"steel grade is 8";
    else if(h>50 && t>5600)
        cout<<"steel grade is 10";
    else if(h>50 || c<0.7 || t>5600)
        cout<<"steel grade is 6";
    else
        cout<<"steel grade is 5";

}

```
### Output
```
Enter the hardness, Carbon & Tensile strength-
4
5
6
Steel grade is 5
```

## Java Implementation
### (i)Hardness must be greater than 50
### (ii)Carbon content must be less than 0.
### (iii)Tensile strength must be greater than 5600

### The grades are as follows:
### Grade is 10 if all three conditions are met −Grade is 9 if conditions (i) and (ii) are met
### Grade is 8 if conditions (ii) and (iii) are met
### Grade is 7 if conditions (i) and (iii) are met
### Grade is 6 if only one condition is met
### Grade is 5 if none of the conditions are met

### Write a Java program, which will require the user to give values of hardness, carbon content and tensile strength of the steel under consideration and output the grade of the steel.

```js
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Funycode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner z=new Scanner(System.in);
        int h,t;
        float c;
        System.out.println("Enter the hardness,Carbon & Tensile strength-\n");
        h=z.nextInt();
        c=z.nextFloat();
        t=z.nextInt();
        if(h>50 && c<0.7 && t>5600)
            System.out.println("steel grade is 10");
        else if(h>50 && c<0.7)
            System.out.println("steel grade is 9");
        else if(c<0.7 && t>5600)
            System.out.println("steel grade is 8");
        else if(h>50 && t>5600)
            System.out.println("steel grade is 10");
        else if(h>50 || c<0.7 || t>5600)
            System.out.println("steel grade is 6");
        else
            System.out.println("steel grade is 5");
    }
}
```
### Output
```
Enter the hardness, Carbon & Tensile strength-
4
5
6
Steel grade is 5
```
