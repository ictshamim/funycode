title: In a company an employee is paid as under, If his basic salary is less than Rs. 1500, then HRA = 10% of basic salary and DA = 90% of basic salary. If his salary is either equal to or above Rs. 1500, then HRA = Rs. 500 and DA = 98% of basic salary. If the employee’s salary is input through the keyboard write a program to find his gross salary.

## C Implementation
### Program-32: In a company an employee is paid as under: If his basic salary is less than Rs. 1500, then HRA = 10% of basic salary and DA = 90% of basic salary. If his salary is either equal to or above Rs. 1500, then HRA = Rs. 500 and DA = 98% of basic salary. If the employee’s salary is input through the keyboard write a C program to find his gross salary.
```c
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int bs,gs;
    printf("Enter the basic salary-");
    scanf("%d",&bs);
    if(bs<1500)
        printf("gs=%d\n",bs+bs*10/100+bs*90/100);
    else if(bs>=1500)
        printf("gs=%d\n",bs+500+bs*98/100);
}
```
### Output
```
Enter the basic salary-
20000
Gross salary=40100
```

## C++ Implementation
### Program-32: In a company an employee is paid as under: If his basic salary is less than Rs. 1500, then HRA = 10% of basic salary and DA = 90% of basic salary. If his salary is either equal to or above Rs. 1500, then HRA = Rs. 500 and DA = 98% of basic salary. If the employee’s salary is input through the keyboard write a C++ program to find his gross salary.
```c
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int bs,gs;
    cout<<"enter the basic salary-\n";
    cin>>bs;
    if(bs<1500)
        cout<<"gross salary="<<(bs+bs*10/100+bs*90/100);
    else if(bs>=1500)
        cout<<"gross salary="<<(bs+500+bs*98/100);
}
```
### Output
```
Enter the basic salary-
20000
Gross salary=40100
```

## Java Implementation
### Program-32: In a company an employee is paid as under: If his basic salary is less than Rs. 1500, then HRA = 10% of basic salary and DA = 90% of basic salary. If his salary is either equal to or above Rs. 1500, then HRA = Rs. 500 and DA = 98% of basic salary. If the employee’s salary is input through the keyboard write a java program to find his gross salary.
```js
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Funycode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner z=new Scanner(System.in);
        int bs,gs;
        System.out.println("enter the basic salary-\n");
        bs=z.nextInt();
        if(bs<1500)
            System.out.println("gross salary="+(bs+bs*10/100+bs*90/100));
        else if(bs>=1500)
            System.out.println("gross salary="+(bs+500+bs*98/100));
    }
}
```
### Output
```
Enter the basic salary-
20000
Gross salary=40100
```
