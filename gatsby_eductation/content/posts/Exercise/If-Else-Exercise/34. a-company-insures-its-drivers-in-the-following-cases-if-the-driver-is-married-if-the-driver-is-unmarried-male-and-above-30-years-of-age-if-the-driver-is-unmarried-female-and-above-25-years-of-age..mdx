## C Implementation
### Program-34: A company insures its drivers in the following cases:
### If the driver is married.
### If the driver is unmarried, male & above 30 years of age.
### If the driver is unmarried, female & above 25 years of age.
```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a;
    char s,i;
    printf("Enter the driver's age, gender & marital status-");
    scanf("%d %c %c",&a,&s,&i);
    if(i=='m')
        printf("the driver is insured");
    else if(a>30 && s=='m' && i=='u')
        printf("the driver is insured");
    else if(a>25 && s=='f' && i=='u')
        printf("the driver is insured");
    else
        printf("the driver is not insured");
}
```
### Output
```
Enter the driver's age, gender & marital status-
30
m
u
the driver is not insured
```

## C++ Implementation

### If the driver is married.
### If the driver is unmarried, male & above 30 years of age.
### If the driver is unmarried, female & above 25 years of age.
```c
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()

    cout<<"enter the driver's age,gender & marital status-\n";
    cin>>a>>s>>i;

        cout<<"the driver is insured";
    else if(a>30 && s=='m' && i=='u')
        cout<<"the driver is insured";

        cout<<"the driver is insured";
     else
            cout<<"the driver is not insured";
}
```
### Output
```
Enter the driver's age, gender & marital status-
30
m
u
the driver is not insured
```

## Java Implementation
