## C Implementation
### Program-19: Write a C program to find out the largest between three numbers.
```c
/*Write a C program to find out the largest between three numbers.*/
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int a,b,c;
    printf("Enter three Number:");
    scanf("%d%d%d",&a,&b,&c);
    if(a>b&&a>c)
        printf("%d is the largest number",a);
    if(b>a&&b>c)
        printf("%d is the largest number",b);
    if(c>a&&c>b)
        printf("%d is the largest number",c);
}
```
### Output
```
Enter three Number:
5
6
4
6 is the largest number
```

## C++ Implementation
### Program-19: Write a C++ program to find out the largest between three numbers.
```c
/*Write a C++ program to find out the largest between three numbers.*/
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a,b,c;
    cout<<"enter three numbers-\n";
    cin>>a>>b>>c;
    if(a>b&&a>c)
        cout<<a<<" is the largest number";
    if(b>a&&b>c)
        cout<<b<<" is the largest number";
    if(c>a&&c>b)
        cout<<c<<" is the largest number";
}
```
### Output
```
Enter three Number:
5
6
4
6 is the largest number
```

## Java Implementation
### Program-19: Write a java  program to find out the largest between three numbers.
```js
/*Write a java program to find out the largest between three numbers.*/
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Funycode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner z=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a,b,c;
        System.out.print("Enter three Number:\n");
        a=z.nextInt();
        b=z.nextInt();
        c=z.nextInt();

        if(a>b&&a>c)
            System.out.print(a+ " is the largest number");
        if(b>a&&b>c)
            System.out.print(b+ " is the largest number");
        if(c>a&&c>b)
            System.out.print(c+ " is the largest number");
    }
}
```
### Output
```
Enter three Number:
5
6
4
6 is the largest number
```
