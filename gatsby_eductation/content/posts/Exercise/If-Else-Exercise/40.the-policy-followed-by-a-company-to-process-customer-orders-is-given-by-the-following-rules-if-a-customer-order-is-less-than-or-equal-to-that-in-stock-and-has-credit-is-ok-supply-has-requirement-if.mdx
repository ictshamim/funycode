## C Implementation
### Program-40: The policy followed by a company to process customer orders is given by the following rules: If a customer order is less than or equal to that in stock and has credit is OK, supply has requirement. −If has credit is not OK do not supply. Send him intimation. −If has credit is Ok but the item in stock is less than has order, supply what is in stock. Intimate to him data the balance will be shipped. Write a C program to implement the company policy
```c
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int order,stock;
    char credit;
    printf("Enter the order,stock & credit of a customer-");
    scanf("%d%d %c",&order,&stock,&credit);
    if((order<=stock)&&credit=='k')
        printf("supply has requirement");
    else if((order<=stock)&&(credit!='k'))
        printf("not supply and send information");
    else if((order>=stock)&&(credit=='k'))
        printf("supply whats is in store and intimate to him date");
}
```
### Output
```
Enter the order,stock & credit of a customer-
5
6
k
supply has requirement
```

## C++ Implementation
### Program-40: The policy followed by a company to process customer orders is given by the following rules: If a customer order is less than or equal to that in stock and has credit is OK, supply has requirement. −If has credit is not OK do not supply. Send him intimation. −If has credit is Ok but the item in stock is less than has order, supply what is in stock. Intimate to him data the balance will be shipped. Write a C++ program to implement the company policy.
```c
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int order,stock;
    char credit;
    cout<<"Enter the order,stock & credit of a customer-\n";
    cin>>order>>stock>>credit;
    if((order<=stock)&&credit=='k')
        cout<<"supply has requirement";
    else if((order<=stock)&&(credit!='k'))
        cout<<"not supply and send information";
    else if((order>=stock)&&(credit=='k'))
        cout<<"supply whats is in store and intimate to him date";
}
```
### Output
```
Enter the order,stock & credit of a customer-
5
6
k
supply has requirement
```

## Java Implementation
### Program-40: The policy followed by a company to process customer orders is given by the following rules: If a customer order is less than or equal to that in stock and has credit is OK, supply has requirement. −If has credit is not OK do not supply. Send him intimation. −If has credit is Ok but the item in stock is less than has order, supply what is in stock. Intimate to him data the balance will be shipped. Write a java program to implement the company policy.
```js
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Funycode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner z=new Scanner(System.in);
        int order,stock;
        char credit;
        System.out.println("Enter the order,stock & credit of a customer-\n");
        order=z.nextInt();
        stock=z.nextInt();
        credit=z.next().charAt(0);
        if((order<=stock)&&credit=='k')
            System.out.println("supply has requirement");
        else if((order<=stock)&&(credit!='k'))
            System.out.println("not supply and send information");
        else if((order>=stock)&&(credit=='k'))
            System.out.println("supply whats is in store and intimate to him date");
        else
            System.out.println("Invalid");
    }
}
```
### Output
```
Enter the order,stock & credit of a customer-
5
6
k
supply has requirement
```
