## C Implementation
### Program-22: Write a C program to check whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11 or not.
```c
/*Write a C program to check whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11 or not.*/
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int a;
    printf("Enter a Number:");
    scanf("%d",&a);
    if(a%5==0 && a%11==0)
        printf("number is visible");
    else
        printf("number is not divisible");
}
```
### Output
```
Enter a Number:
55
number is visible by 5 and 11
```

## C++ Implementation
### Program-22: Write a C++ program to check whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11 or not.
```c
/*Write a C++ program to check whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11 or not.*/
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a;
    cout<<"enter a number-\n";
    cin>>a;
    if(a%5==0 && a%11==0)
        cout<<"number is visible by 5 and 11";
    else
        cout<<"number is not divisible";
}

```
### Output
```
Enter a Number:
55
number is visible by 5 and 11
```

## Java Implementation
### Program-22: Write a java program to check whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11 or not.
```js
/*Write a java program to check whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11 or not.*/
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Funycode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner z=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a;
        System.out.print("Enter a Number:\n");
        a=z.nextInt();

        if(a%5==0 && a%11==0)
            System.out.print("number is visible by 5 and 11");
        else
            System.out.print("number is not divisible");
    }
}
```
### Output
```
Enter a Number:
55
number is visible by 5 and 11
```
