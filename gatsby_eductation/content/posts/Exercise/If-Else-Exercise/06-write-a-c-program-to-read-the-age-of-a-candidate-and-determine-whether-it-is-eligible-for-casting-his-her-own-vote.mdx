## C Implementation
### Program-6: Write a C program to read the age of a candidate and determine whether it is eligible for casting his/her own vote.
```c
/*Write a C program to read the age of a candidate and determine whether it is eligible for casting his/her own vote.*/
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a;
    printf("Enter a Age:");
    scanf("%d",&a);
    if(a>=18)
        printf("eligible for casting his/her vote");
    else
        printf("not eligible for casting his/her vote ");
}
```
### Output
```
Enter a Age:
25
eligible for casting his/her vote
```

## C++ Implementation
### Program-6: Write a C++ program to read the age of a candidate and determine whether it is eligible for casting his/her own vote.
```c
/*Write a C++ program to read the age of a candidate and determine whether it is eligible for casting his/her own vote.*/
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a;
    cout<<"Enter a Age-\n";
    cin>>a;
    if(a>=18)
        cout<<"eligible for casting his/her vote";
    else
        cout<<"not eligible for casting his/her vote ";
}
```
### Output
```
Enter a Age:
25
eligible for casting his/her vote
```

## Java Implementation
### Program-6: Write a java program to read the age of a candidate and determine whether it is eligible for casting his/her own vote.
```js
/*Write a java program to read the age of a candidate and determine whether it is eligible for casting his/her own vote.*/
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Funycode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner z=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a,b;
        System.out.println("Enter a Age:");
        a=z.nextInt();
        if(a>=18)
            System.out.println("eligible for casting his/her vote");
        else
            System.out.println("not eligible for casting his/her vote ");
    }
}
```
### Output
```
Enter a Age:
25
eligible for casting his/her vote
```
