## C Implementation
### Program-30: While purchasing certain items, a discount of 10% is offered if the quantity purchased is more than 1 000. If quantity and price per item are input through the keyboard, write a c program to calculate the total expenses.
```c
/*While purchasing certain items, a discount of 10% is offered if the quantity purchased is more than 1 000. If quantity and price per item are input through the keyboard, write a c program to calculate the total expenses.*/
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int q,p;
    printf("Enter quantity and price per item-");
    scanf("%d%d",&q,&p);
    if(q>1000)
        printf("total expenses=%d",((p*q)+(p*q)*10/100));
    else
        printf("total expenses=%d",p*q);
}
```
### Output
```
Enter quantity and price per item-
5
1000
total expenses=5000
```

## C++ Implementation
### Program-30: While purchasing certain items, a discount of 10% is offered if the quantity purchased is more than 1 000. If quantity and price per item are input through the keyboard, write a C++ program to calculate the total expenses.
```c
/*While purchasing certain items, a discount of 10% is offered if the quantity purchased is more than 1 000. If quantity and price per item are input through the keyboard, write a c++ program to calculate the total expenses.*/
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int q,p;
    cout<<"enter quantity and price per item-\n";
    cin>>q>>p;
    if(q>1000)
        cout<<"total expenses="<<((p*q)-(p*q)*10/100);
    else
        cout<<"total expenses="<<p*q;
}
```
### Output
```
enter quantity and price per item-
5
1000
total expenses=5000
```

## Java Implementation
### Program-30: While purchasing certain items, a discount of 10% is offered if the quantity purchased is more than 1 000. If quantity and price per item are input through the keyboard, write a java program to calculate the total expenses.
```js
/*While purchasing certain items, a discount of 10% is offered if the quantity purchased is more than 1 000. If quantity and price per item are input through the keyboard, write a java program to calculate the total expenses.*/
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Funycode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner z=new Scanner(System.in);
        int q,p;
        System.out.println("enter quantity and price per item-\n");
        q=z.nextInt();
        p=z.nextInt();
        if(q>1000)
             System.out.println("total expenses="+((p*q)-(p*q)*10/100));
        else
            System.out.println("total expenses="+p*q);
    }
}
```
### Output
```
enter quantity and price per item-
5
1000
total expenses=5000
```
