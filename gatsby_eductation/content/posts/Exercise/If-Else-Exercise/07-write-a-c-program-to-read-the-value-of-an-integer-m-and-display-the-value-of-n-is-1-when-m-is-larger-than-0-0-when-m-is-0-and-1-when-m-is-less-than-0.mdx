## C Implementation
### Program-7: Write a C program to read the value of an integer m and display the value of n is 1 when m is larger than 0, 0 when m is 0 and -1 when m is less than 0.
```c
/*Write a C program to read the value of an integer m and display the value of n is 1 when m is larger than 0, 0 when m is 0 and -1 when m is less than 0.*/
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int m;
    Printf("Enter a Number:");
    scanf("%d",&m);
    if(m>0)
        printf("n is 1");
    if(m==0)
        printf("n is 0");
        if(m<0)
        printf("n is -1");
}
```
### Output
```
Enter a Number:
24
n is 1
```

## C++ Implementation
### Program-7: Write a C++ program to read the value of an integer m and display the value of n is 1 when m is larger than 0, 0 when m is 0 and -1 when m is less than 0.
```c
/*Write a C++ program to read the value of an integer m and display the value of n is 1 when m is larger than 0, 0 when m is 0 and -1 when m is less than 0.*/
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int m;
    cout<<"enter the value of an integer m-\n";
    cin>>m;
    if(m>0)
        cout<<"n is 1";
    if(m==0)
        cout<<"n is 0";
    if(m<0)
        cout<<"n is -1";
}
```
### Output
```
Enter a Number:
24
n is 1
```

## Java Implementation
### Program-7: Write a java program to read the value of an integer m and display the value of n is 1 when m is larger than 0, 0 when m is 0 and -1 when m is less than 0.
```js
/*Write a java program to read the value of an integer m and display the value of n is 1 when m is larger than 0, 0 when m is 0 and -1 when m is less than 0.*/
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Funycode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner z=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a,b;
        System.out.println("Enter a Number:");
        a=z.nextInt();
        if(a>0)
            System.out.println("n is 1");
        if(a==0)
            System.out.println("n is 0");
        if(a<0)
            System.out.println("n is -1");
    }
}
```
### Output
```
Enter a Number:
24
n is 1
```
