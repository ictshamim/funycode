## C Implementation
### Program-31: The current year and the year in which the employee joined the organization are entered through the keyboard. If the number of years for which the employee has served the organization is greater than 3 then a bonus of Rs. 2500/- is given to the employee. If the years of service are not greater than 3, then the program should do nothing.
```c
/*The current year and the year in which the employee joined the organization are entered through the keyboard. If the number of years for which the employee has served the organization is greater than 3 then a bonus of Rs. 2500/- is given to the employee. If the years of service are not greater than 3, then the program should do nothing.*/
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int cy,yj;
    printf("Enter the current year and the year of joining-");
    scanf("%d %d",&cy,&yj);
    if(cy-yj>3)
        printf("bonus of Rs 2500/-");
    else
        printf("program error");
}
```
### Output
```
Enter the current year and the year of joining-
2021
2015
bonus of Rs 2500/-
