title: An Insurance company follows following rules to calculate premium If a person’s health is excellent and the person is between 25 and 35 years of age and lives in a city and is a male then the premium is Rs. 4 per thousand and his policy amount cannot exceed Rs. 2 lakhs. −If a person satisfies all the above conditions except that the sex is female then the premium is Rs. 3 per thousand and her policy amount cannot exceed Rs. 1 lakh −If a person’s health is poor and the person is between 25 and 35 years of age and lives in a village and is a male then the premium is Rs. 6 per thousand and his policy cannot exceed Rs. 10,000 −In all other cases the person is not insured.

## C Implementation
### Program-37: An Insurance company follows following rules to calculate premium

### If a person’s health is excellent and the person is between 25 and 35 years of age and lives in a city and is a male then the premium is Rs. 4 per thousand and his policy amount cannot exceed Rs. 2 lakhs.
### If a person satisfies all the above conditions except that the sex is female then the premium is Rs. 3 per thousand and her policy amount cannot exceed Rs. 1 lakh
### If a person’s health is poor and the person is between 25 and 35 years of age and lives in a village and is a male then the premium is Rs. 6 per thousand and his policy cannot exceed Rs. 10,000
### In all other cases the person is not insured.

### Write a C program to output whether the person should be insured or not, his/her premium rate and maximum amount for which he/she can be insured.
```c
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int age,premium,max;
    char health,location,sex;
    printf("Enter health, age, location & gender of a person-");
    scanf(" %c%d %c %c",&health,&age,&location,&sex);
    if((health=='e')&&(age>=25&&age<=35)&&(location=='c')&&(sex=='m'))
    {
        premium=4;
        max=2;
        printf("premium %d Rs per thousand and policy amount cannot exceed %d lakhs",premium,max);
    }
    else if((health=='e')&&(age>=25&&age<=35)&&(location=='c')&&(sex=='f'))
    {
        premium=3;
        max=1;
        printf("premium %d Rs per thousand and policy amount cannot exceed %d lakhs",premium,max);
    }
    else if((health=='p')&&(age>=25&&age<=35)&&(location=='v')&&(sex=='m'))
    {
        premium=6;
        max=10,000;
        printf("premium %d Rs per thousand and policy amount cannot exceed %d lakhs",premium,max);
    }
    else
        printf("person is not insured");
}
```
### Output
```
Enter health, age, location & gender of a person-
e
30
c
f
premium Rs. 3 per thousand and policy amount cannot exceed 1 lakhs
```

## C++ Implementation
### Program-37: An Insurance company follows following rules to calculate premium

### If a person’s health is excellent and the person is between 25 and 35 years of age and lives in a city and is a male then the premium is Rs. 4 per thousand and his policy amount cannot exceed Rs. 2 lakhs.
### If a person satisfies all the above conditions except that the sex is female then the premium is Rs. 3 per thousand and her policy amount cannot exceed Rs. 1 lakh
### If a person’s health is poor and the person is between 25 and 35 years of age and lives in a village and is a male then the premium is Rs. 6 per thousand and his policy cannot exceed Rs. 10,000
### In all other cases the person is not insured.

### Write a C++ program to output whether the person should be insured or not, his/her premium rate and maximum amount for which he/she can be insured.
```c
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int age,premium,m;
    char health,location,sex;
    cout<<"enter health,age,location & gender of a person-\n";
    cin>>health>>age>>location>>sex;
    if((health=='e')&&(age>=25&&age<=35)&&(location=='c')&&(sex=='m'))
    {
        cout<<"premium Rs. 4 per thousand and policy amount cannot exceed 2 lakhs";
    }
    else if((health=='e')&&(age>=25&&age<=35)&&(location=='c')&&(sex=='f'))
    {
        cout<<"premium Rs. 3 per thousand and policy amount cannot exceed 1 lakhs";
    }
    else if((health=='p')&&(age>=25&&age<=35)&&(location=='v')&&(sex=='m'))
    {
        cout<<"premium Rs.6 per thousand and policy amount cannot exceed 10,000 lakhs";
    }
    else
        cout<<"person is not insured";
}
```
### Output
```
Enter health, age, location & gender of a person-
e
30
c
f
premium Rs. 3 per thousand and policy amount cannot exceed 1 lakhs
```
