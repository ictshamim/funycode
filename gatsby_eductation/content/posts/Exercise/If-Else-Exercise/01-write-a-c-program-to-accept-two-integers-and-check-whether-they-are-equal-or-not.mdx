## C Implementation
### Program-1: Write a C++ program to accept two integers and check whether they are equal or not.
```c
/*Write a C program to accept two integers and check whether they are equal or not.*/
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a,b;
    printf("Input Two Integer");
    scanf("%d %d",&a,&b);
    if(a==b)
        printf("They are Equal");
    else
        printf("They are not Equal");
}
```
### Output
```
Input Two Integer
5
8
They are not Equal
```

## C++ Implementation
### Program-1: Write a C++ program to accept two integers and check whether they are equal or not.
```c
/*Write a C++ program to accept two integers and check whether they are equal or not.*/
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a,b;
    cout<<"input two integer-\n";
    cin>>a>>b;
    if(a==b)
        cout<<"They are Equal";
    else
        cout<<"They are not Equal";
}
```
### Output
```
Input Two Integer
5
8
They are not Equal
```

## Java Implementation
### Program-1: Write a java program to accept two integers and check whether they are equal or not.
```js
/*Write a java program to accept two integers and check whether they are equal or not.*/
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Funycode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner z=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a,b;
        System.out.println("Input Two Integer");
        a=z.nextInt();
        b=z.nextInt();
        if(a==b)
            System.out.println("They are Equal");
        else
            System.out.println("They are not Equal");

    }
}
```
### Output
```
Input Two Integer
5
8
They are not Equal
```
