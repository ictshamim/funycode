A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. It has a name and it is reusable.
It can be executed from as many different parts in a program as required, it can also return a value to
calling program. All executable code resides within a function. It takes input, does something with it,
then give the answer. A C program consists of one or more functions. The function exercise program list
has been given bellow. All the programs have been solved in three programming languages are C, C++ and Java.
Start your journey with C, C++ and Java programming with the function program list-
