Reusability is yet another aspect of OOP paradigm. It is always nice if we could reuse something that already exists rather than creating the same all over again. Java supports this concept. Java classes can be reused in several ways. This is basically done by creating new classes, reusing the properties of existing ones. The mechanism of deriving a new class from an old one is called inheritance.`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`The process by which one class acquires the properties (data members) and functionalities (methods) of another class is called inheritance.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`The aim of inheritance is to provide the reusability of code so that a class has to write only the unique features and rest of the common properties and functionalities can be extended from the another class.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Inheritance is a process of defining a new class based on an existing class by extending its common data members and methods.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`Inheritance allows us to reuse of code, it improves reusability in your java application.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`The biggest advantage of Inheritance is that the code that is already present in base class need not be rewritten in the child class.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`This means that the data members (instance variables) and methods of the parent class can be used in the child class.`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"child-class\"\n    }}>{`Child Class`}</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`The class that extends the features of another class is known as child class, sub class or derived class.`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"parent-class\"\n    }}>{`Parent Class`}</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`The class whose properties and functionalities are used(inherited) by another class is known as parent class, super class or Base class.`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"syntax-of-inheritance-in-java\"\n    }}>{`Syntax of Inheritance in Java`}</h2>\n    <p>{`To inherit the property of super class extends keyword is used in the following ways`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-js\"\n      }}>{`class subClassName extends superClassName{\nvariable declaration;\nmethod declaration;\n}\n`}</code></pre>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`The keyword extends signifies that the properties of superClassName are extended to the subClassName.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`The subclass will now contains its own variable and methods as well those of the superclass.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`This kind of situation occurs when we want to add some more properties to an existing class without actually modifying it.`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"types-of-inheritance\"\n    }}>{`Types of Inheritance`}</h2>\n    <p>{`The inheritance allows subclasses to inherit all the variables and methods of their parent classes.
