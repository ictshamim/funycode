statement is one of decision-making control-flow statements. It tests the value of an expression\nagainst a list of integer or character constants. When a match is found the statements associated with that\nconstants are executed. The conditional operator is also known as a ternary operator. The conditional\nstatements are the decision-making statements which depends upon the output of the expression.\nIt is represented by two symbols, i.e., ’?’ and ’:‘. The switch and conditional operator exercise program\nlist has been given bellow. All the programs have been solved in three programming languages are C, C++ and\nJava.
